# Sticky Tape Lab 

- When Tape is pulled apart the individual pieces of tape become *charged*. 

## 🎯 How do these charged pieces of tape interact with each other?

---

# Charge 

* All objects have charge 
* Charge is based on number of protons (➕) or electrons (➖)
* Charge is negative or positive

--- 

# Elementary Charge 

* A fundamental property of matter
* Charge is quantized ➡️ Comes in specific amounts 
* An elementary charge is the smallest sized charge (like a penny in USD)
* Charge can be measured in:
    * Elementary Charges ($e$) (small amounts)
    * Coulombs ($C$)

---

<br>
<br>

## ➕ Protons: 1e = $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ Coulombs

<br>
<br>

## ➖ Electrons: -1e = $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ Coulombs

---

# ❓ Check Your Understanding

How many extra electrons does an object with a charge of $-9.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C have?

---

# Conservation of Charge 

The total change in a system is constant 

---

# Conservation of Charge 

❓ What will the charge of each sphere be after the spheres are touched together and removed?

---

# Conservation of Charge 

- Total Charge is conserved
- Total Charge is distrubuted evenly

# Laws of attraction

1. Opposite Charges Attract
2. Like Charges Repel 
3. Charge objects *always* **attract** neutral objects

# Coulomb's Law 

$$ F_e = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} $$

* $F_e$ :arrow_right: electrostatic force
* $k$ ➡️ electrostatic constant = $8.99 \times 10^{9}$ Nm$^2$/C$^2$
* $q$ ➡️ charge 
* $r$ ➡️ distance between the centers

---

# Example:

What is the electrical force between two very small objects located 0.5 m apart when the charge on one object is 4.0 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ C and the charge on the second object is 6.0 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ C?

---

# Graph Example:

What shows the relationship between the electrostatics force and the distance?

---

# Example:

Two charges attract each other with a force of F. If one charge was doubled and the other charge was tripled, how would that change the attractive force between those charges?
