# Sticky Tape Lab 

- When Tape is pulled apart the individual pieces of tape become *charged*. 

## üéØ How do these charged pieces of tape interact with each other?

---

# Charge 

* All objects have charge 
* Charge is based on number of protons (‚ûï) or electrons (‚ûñ)
* Charge is negative or positive

--- 

# Elementary Charge 

* A fundamental property of matter
* Charge is quantized ‚û°Ô∏è Comes in specific amounts 
* An elementary charge is the smallest sized charge (like a penny in USD)
* Charge can be measured in:
    * Elementary Charges ($e$) (small amounts)
    * Coulombs ($C$)

---

<br>
<br>

## ‚ûï Protons: 1e = $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ Coulombs

<br>
<br>

## ‚ûñ Electrons: -1e = $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ Coulombs

# ‚ùì Check Your Understanding

How many extra electrons does an object with a charge of $-9.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C have?

---

# Conservation of Charge 

The total change in a system is constant 

---

# Conservation of Charge 

‚ùì What will the charge of each sphere be after the spheres are touched together and removed?

---

# Conservation of Charge 

- Total Charge is conserved
- Total Charge is distrubuted evenly

# Laws of attraction

1. Opposite Charges Attract
2. Like Charges Repel 
3. Charge objects *always* **attract** neutral objects

# Coulomb's Law 

$$ F_e = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} $$

* $F_e$ :arrow_right: electrostatic force
* $k$ ‚û°Ô∏è electrostatic constant = $8.99 \times 10^{9}$ Nm$^2$/C$^2$
* $q$ ‚û°Ô∏è charge 
* $r$ ‚û°Ô∏è distance between the centers

# Example:

## What is the electrical force between two very small objects located 0.5 m apart when the charge on one object is 4.0 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ C and the charge on the second object is 6.0 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ C?

---

# Graph Example:

What shows the relationship between the electrostatics force and the distance?

![width:1100px](CLGraphs.png)

---

# Example:

## Two charges attract each other with a force of F. If one charge was doubled and the other charge was tripled, how would that change the attractive force between those charges?


---

# Mapping the Electric Field 

1. Using a ruler measure the distance between the charges.
2. Calculate the electrostatic force between the two charges.
3. Draw a *scaled* vector starting on the test charge that represents the force between the test charge and the central charge.

---

# *Electric Field*

## A region in space where electric forces will act on charges.

# Electric Field 

$$ E = \frac{F_e}{q} $$

- $E$ ‚û°Ô∏è Electric Field Strength (N/C)
- $F_e$ ‚û°Ô∏è Electrostatic Force (N)

# Comparison to Gravity

# Example:

## What is the magnitude of the electric field intensity at a point in the field where an electron experiences 1 N of force?

# Potential & Gravity Comparison

- What is Potential?
    - What is gravity?
    - Where does it come from?
    - How do you know it is present?
    - What do you change an object's $PE_g$?
    - What is Earth's gravitational field strength?

## Electric Energy 

The work needed or energy required by moving a positive charge in an electric field

$$ W = Fd = (qE)d = \overbrace{qV}^{\textrm{EPE}} = \underbrace{mgh}_{\textrm{PEg}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

# Potential Difference (AKA *Voltage*)

This is the potential energy difference per unit charge between two points. 


$$V = \frac{W}{q}$$
