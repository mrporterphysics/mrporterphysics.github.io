## CER

On the next slide there is a list of statements. Decide if the the statement is ***true*** or ***false*** and then support that claim with evidence from the simulation and reasoning based on our models of motion and forces.

# [Phet Tug of War](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/forces-and-motion-basics/latest/forces-and-motion-basics_all.html):

1. A person's location on the rope matters.
2. Different combinations of people can produce the same sum of forces.
3. The sum of the forces on the cart is always equal to the addition of the individual forces.
4. It is impossible for the cart to accelerate to the left if there are people pulling it to the right.
5. The side with the bigger person will always win.
6. The side with more people will always win.
7. It is impossible to make the cart decrease in speed.
8. It is impossible to make the cart move at a steady speed.
9. The cart will always move in the direction of the sum of the forces.
10. If the sum of the forces is zero, the cart must be at rest.

# ✏️ Write a Summary <!--fit--->

# How do forces affect the motion of an object?

You can do this in ***2 sentences***

# Newton's First Law


### When the forces acting on a system are **unbalanced** the system will **accelerate**. 

### When forces acting on a system are **balanced** the system will maintain its **constant velocity**.

# AKA: Law of Inertia

### **Inertia** - Object's tendency to resist change in motion; it is related to the object's mass

## No force is required to get an object to move if it is already moving.  A force is required to change an objects state of motion or rest.

# A **force** is <!--fit--->

# an *interaction* between two objects.  <!--fit--->


### Forcse can be a result of **contact** or due to forces **at a distance** <!--fit--->

# Newton's Third Law 

## A **force** is an interaction between two objects. The two objects mutually apply this **force** on each other. The force is **always *equal in magntiude and opposite in direction***.

---

# Force Pairs 

* Newton's Third Law describes force pairs 
  * You can identify these pairs with an interaction diagram
  * The line that connects each bubble or object is the force pair. 

---

### Contact Interactions 

1. ***Compression***: when two objects' surfaces are pushed together and the surfaces *deform*
2. ***Stretch***: when two objects pull on each other and are elongated
3. ***Shear***: When surfaces pull on each other as they slide or attempt to slide
