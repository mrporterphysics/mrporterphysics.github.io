# Mallet Ball

### We are going to try and recreate uniform motion (constant acceleration) where $a=0$ and $a\ne 0$ with objects moving over smooth, hard, level surfaces.

* First with a bowling ball,
* then  by looking at a simulation

---

<style scoped>section { font-size: 31px; }</style>

### Bowling Ball Situations - Using a mallet and a bowling ball:

Each time we use the mallet, let it bounce. (Don’t use the mallet like a bulldozer.)

* Start with a stationary bowling ball. Then, speed up the bowling ball from rest.
* Have someone roll a bowling ball. Then, bring it to a stop.
* Have someone roll a bowling ball. Then, keep it moving at a CV.
* Have someone roll a bowling ball. With one tap, have the bowling ball make a 90 degree turn.
* Keep a bowling ball moving in a circle at constant speed.

**Your goal: summarize the relation between taps and motion in as few statments as possible**

---

# Lab Safety: 

1. No High Mallets 
2. Be aware of your surroundings 
3. No excessive rolls 
4. No smashing into walls, mats, classmates, etc. 

---

# Lab Instructions:

1) Everyone in your group should _play mallet ball_ at least once. 
2) As a group think about how you will accomplish the mallet ball task. 
3) Attempt to accomplish task. 
4) Record how you successfully accomplished the task
    * Written description
    * Drawing that models the motion and your mallet taps
5) Finally, write a general descriptive model that explains how mallet taps relate to the motion of the bowling ball

---

<!-- _align: center -->

# How do **taps** relate to the **motion** of the bowling ball?

---



# Does our rule relating motion and taps work for the bowling ball tapping the mallet? Or in other words does the bowling ball tap the mallet? 

---


# What would happen as we make the taps more "constant"?

---

# What is a **Force**?
- An interaction between two objects
- Forces are the cause for differing motion

---

# Motion is a result of **all forces** acting on an object. 

---

# Pivot - Balanced vs. **Unbalanced** Forces

## How does motion differ when forces are balances vs. unbalanced?

---

# Newton's First Law

---
# Balanced Forces

- Net force = 0
- Object either:
  - Stays at rest
  - Continues at constant speed

---
# Unbalanced Forces

- Net force ≠ 0  
- Object:
  - Speeds up
  - Slows down
  - Changes direction


---
# Newton's First Law (Inertia)

* ## **Inertia** is an object's resistance to _changes_ in its state of motion


* ## The amount of inertia is based solely on its **mass**

---
# Mass and Inertia
- Mass = amount of matter
- More mass = more inertia
- Example:
  - Harder to start/stop heavy cart
  - Easier to start/stop light cart

# Pre-Conceptions 

Students typically have many pre-conceived notions regarding concepts in Physics. It has always proven useful to bring these ideas to the forefront of your mind and to make an effort to evaluate their correctness. The following statements pertain in one way or another to common notions regarding central concepts of this unit. Identify each statement as being either true (T) or false (F).

# ⚖️ Lab: **Mass vs. Weight**

## Objective: 

#### **_Determine the mathematical relationship between mass and weight using a spring scale._**

### Notes:

- Don't forget a diagram of your setup 
- Include units in your measurements
- Will need graph and equation for line of best fit

---

# 🌎 Gravity $F_g$ 

## Notes:

* Weight == $F_g$ == Force of Gravity...so $F_g = mg$
* Weight is a **FORCE**, mass is scalar quantity
* $g$ is the gravitational field strength
    * Measured in N/kg 
    * changes based on planet and location on that planet
    * _near the surface of the Earth_ $g = 9.8 \textrm{ N/kg}$

---

# ⚖️ Reminder Mass vs. **Weight**

<div class='columns'>
<div>

## Mass:

- related to how much *stuff* there is
- the **same** regardless of location in universe
- measured in *kilograms* (kg)

</div>
 
<div>

## Weight: 

- How much Earth is pulling on that *stuff*
- depends on the gravitational field strength ($g$)
- measured in *Newtons* (N)

</div>

<div>

![center](image-7.png)

</div>

</div>

---

The diagram to the right shows a 3 kg mass attached to spring scales on Earth, Mars, and Earth's Moon. Use the information in the diagram to calculate the gravitational field strength ($g$) for each Celestial Body.

Reminder:

$$\boxed{g = \frac{F_g}{m}}$$

# A **force** is a push or pull upon an object resulting from the object's **interaction** with another object. 

Whenever there is an interaction between two objects, there is a force upon each of the objects. When the interaction ceases, the two objects no longer experience the force. **Forces only exist as a result of an interaction.**

---

# Force Categories 

<div class='columns'>
<div>

## Contact Forces

- Objects are physically in contact with each other
- Examples: _tension, friction, normal force, air resistance, applied forces_

</div>
 
<div>

## Action at a distance 

- Interaction when objects are not in contact with each other. 
- Examples: _gravitational, electrical , magnetic_

</div>
</div>

---

# What is a **Newton**?

* The unit of force
* 1 N is the amount of net force required to accelerate a 1 kg mass 1 m/s/s. 

$$\boxed{1\textrm{ Newton} = 1\textrm{ kg} \cdot 1 \textrm{ m/s}^2}$$

# **Net Force** $F_{net}$ or $\Sigma F$

## If forces are **unbalanaced** there is there is a total amount of unbalanced force. This is the **net force** on an object. 

### Note: Net force **is not** an individual force. It is a result of adding all of the force vectors acting on an object.

# Drawing Free Body Diagrams 


A special type of force diagram that **represents all the forces acting upon an object**. Arrows represent the forces. The force arrows …

- … are labeled according to type,
- … are pointing in the direction of the force,
- … and have a length that is in proportion to their relative strength (longer arrows are stronger forces).

# Drawing FBDs

1) Identify forces that are present:
    - Is the object near a planet (charge or magnet)?
    - Is the object in contact with another object?
2) Determine the direction of each force
3) Draw an arrow to represent the force starting at the center of the dot or box representing the object and pointing in the direction of the force?
4) Draw the force to scale to represent magnitude
5) Label the arrow with the force type

# What is Friction?

## The friction force is the force exerted by a surface as an object moves across it or makes an effort to move across it. 

---

# What is Friction?

## Friction results from the two surfaces being pressed together closely, causing intermolecular attractive forces between molecules of different surfaces. As such, friction depends upon the nature of the two surfaces and upon the degree to which they are pressed together.

# Friction

$$ \boxed{F_f \le \mu F_N} $$

### Notes: 

* $\le$ is only for **static friction**
  * Why? Only need friction to **balance** so you don't need the _maximum_ amount of static friction 
* $F_f = \mu F_N$ is for **kinetic friction**
* $\mu$ (greek letter mu, pronouced "_mew_") - **coefficient of friction**
  * how likely surface pairs are to interlock
  * _always_ less than 1

# Spring Force - Hooke's Law

$$\boxed{F_s = kx}$$

- $F_s$: Spring Force (Newtons, N)
- $k$: Spring Constant (Newtons per meter, N/m)
- $x$: Change in spring length from equilibrium position (meters, m)

> _Hookean_ Springs are springs that follow Hooke's Law (equation), not intercept and proportional relationship between $F_s$ and $x$.

# Newton's 3rd Law: **Force Pairs**

## _"For every action, there is an equal and opposite action."_

# 😑

### Forces are a result of **two** objects interacting. The force that each object applies on the other is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

## While driving down the road, a firefly strikes the windshield of a bus and makes a quite obvious mess in front of the face of the driver. This is a clear case of Newton's third law of motion. The firefly hit the bus and the bus hits the firefly. **Which of the two forces is greater: the force on the firefly or the force on the bus?**

A block is moving to the right across a rough table at a constant speed of 2 m/s. The tables and the blocks are identical in the two cases. In Case A, the block is pushed with a stick and in Case B, the block is pulled with a string. The angle that the applied force makes with the horizontal is the same in both cases.

_Will the magnitude of the force on the block by the stick in Case A be (i) greater than, (ii) less than, or (iii) equal to the tension on the block by the string in Case B?_

Explain your reasoning.

# Vector Review


* $\vec{A}^2 = \vec{A}_x^2 + \vec{A}_y^2$
* Depending on the angle...
  * $A_x = \pm A \cos \theta$
  * $A_y = \pm A \sin \theta$

## Adding Vectors 


#### Using Components


You can sum the components of the two vectors to find the components of the **resultant** vector 

If $\vec{C} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$...

* $C_x = A_x + B_x$
* $C_y = A_y + B_y$
* $|C| = \sqrt{C_x^2 + C_y^2 }$
