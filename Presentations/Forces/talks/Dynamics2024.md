Mr. Porter and his wife walk from Nighthawks to Troy Savings Bank Music Hall. They walk 6 blocks East and then 2 Blocks South. [1 Block = 100 Meters]

1. Determine the **distance** that they traveled.
2. Determine their  **displacement**.

# Vctor Quantities:

### A *<u>vector</u>* is a quantity with both **magnitude** (size) and **direction**.

#### Examples:

  - The child was displaced 9 meters North.
  - The car has a velocity of 10 meters per second East
  - $\vec{F}$, $\vec{p}$, $\vec{a}$, $\vec{v}$, $\Delta \vec{x}$, etc

# Scalar Quantities

### A *<u>scalar</u>* is a quantity with just **magnitude**.


#### Examples

  - The child traveled a distance of 12 meters
  - The car is moving 20 miles per hour
  - The frog has mass of 0.5 kg.
  - $m$, $t$, $r$, etc

# Vector Components

* Parts of a two-dimensional vector
* The *component* of a vector is the influence of that vector in a given direction.
    * i.e. How far _East_ of a North East displacement did you walk?
* We look at the ***perpendicular components***
    * How much of the vector is in the *x-direction*
    * How much of the vector is in the *y-direction*
* Vector $\vec{A}$ is made up of components $\vec{A}_x$ and $\vec{A}_y$
    * $\vec{A} = \vec{A}_x + \vec{A}_y$

## Adding Vectors 


#### Using Components


You can sum the components of the two vectors to find the components of the **resultant** vector 

* $s_x = a_x + b_x$
* $s_y = a_y + b_y$
* $s = \sqrt{s_x^2 + s_y^2 }$

# Mallet Ball

### We are going to try and recreate constant velocity motion with objects moving over smooth, hard, level surfaces.

* First with a bowling ball,
* then with with fan carts
* finally by looking at a simulation

### Bowling Ball Situations - Using a mallet and a bowling ball:

Each time we use the mallet, let it bounce. (Don‚Äôt use the mallet like a bulldozer.)

* Start with a stationary bowling ball. Then, speed up the bowling ball from rest.
* Have someone roll a bowling ball. Then, bring it to a stop.
* Have someone roll a bowling ball. Then, keep it moving at a constant velocity.
* Have someone roll a bowling ball. With one tap, have the bowling ball make a 90 degree turn.

**Your goal: summarize the relation between taps and motion in as few statments as possible**

# Lab Safety: 

1. No High Mallets 
2. Be aware of your surroundings 
3. No excessive rolls 
4. No smashing into walls, mats, classmates, etc.

# Lab Instructions:

1. Everyone in your group should _play mallet ball_ at least once. 
2. As a group think about how you will accomplish the mallet ball task. 
3. Attempt to accomplish task.

5. The side with the bigger person will always win.
6. The side with more people will always win.
7. It is impossible to make the cart decrease in speed.
8. It is impossible to make the cart move at a steady speed.

2. ***Stretch***: when two objects pull on each other and are elongated

How would you explain this? 

  1. The box is now higher above the ground, so gravity pulls it down harder.
  2. The box is further from the center of the Earth, so the gravity force is less.
  3. The box is further from the center of the Earth, so the gravity force is less, but the change is much too small to see.
  4. The weight of an object is always the same, so the spring stretches by exactly the same amount.

How would you explain this? 

1. The box is now higher above the ground, so gravity pulls it down harder.
1. The Moon is smaller than the Earth, so gravity is weaker there.

1. The weight of an object is always the same.

An elevator makes a trip up and then back down in a building, and a $50 \textrm{ kg}$ woman stands in the elevator for the entire trip. The elevator starts out at rest, then accelerates upward at $2 \textrm{ m/s}^2$, travels at a constant velocity of $2 \textrm{ m/s}$, then slows down at $3 \textrm{ m/s}^2$. After staying at rest for a moment, it again speeds up at $3 \textrm{ m/s}^2$, downward this time, travels at a constant velocity of $2 \textrm{ m/s}$, and then slows down at $2 \textrm{ m/s}^2$.

##### Is the magnitude of the force exerted by Grace on the rope (i) _greater_ in Case A, (ii) _greater_ in Case B, or (iii) _the same_ in both cases?

##### Explain your reasoning.

# Friction

$$ \boxed{F_f \le \mu F_N} $$

### Notes: 

* $\le$ is only for **static friction**
  * Why? Only need friction to **balance** so you don't need the _maximum_ amount of static friction 
* $\mu$ (greek letter mu, pronouced "_mew_") - **coefficient of friction**
  * how likely surface pairs are to interlock
  * _always_ less than 1

## Dexter Eius is running through the cafeteria when he slips on some mashed potatoes and falls to the floor. (Let that be a lesson for Dexter.) Dexter lands in a puddle of milk and skids to a stop with an acceleration of $-4.23 \textrm{ m/s/s}$. Dexter weighs $723.0 \textrm{ N}$. 

## **Determine the coefficient of friction between Dexter and the milky floor**.

## Amaya is driving his $1300 \textrm{-kg}$ car home after soccer practice. He is traveling down Lake Avenue with a speed of $15.8 \textrm{ m/s}$. A deer runs onto the road and Amaya skids to a stop in $3.41 \textrm{ s}$. 

## **Determine the coefficient of friction between the car tires and the roadway.**

#### Consider the free-body diagram shown at the right. If the applied force is 97.7 N at an angle of 27.4 degrees, the force of gravity is 110 N and the coefficient of friction is 0.369, then **what is the acceleration (in m/s/s) of the object?**

Component of gravity ***perpendicular to incline***

$$F_{g\perp} = mg\cos\theta$$



Component of gravity ***parallel to incline***

$$F_{g\parallel} = mg\sin\theta$$

### Accelerating Systems 

![center w:385](image-2.png)

Three blocks are connected by strings and pulled to the right by a force with magnitude $F_0$, as shown in the figure above. All frictional forces are  negligible. The tension in the right and left strings have magnitudes $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. Taking the positive direction to be toward the right, which of the following is a correct equation of motion for the block of mass?

***If the acceleration is $a_{sys}$ derive an expression for $F_0$, $T_1$, and $T_2$ in terms of $a_{sys}$, $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_3$ and any universal constants.***

### Acceleration Systems 

![center w:700](../figures/blocksysrank.png)

Boxes are pulled by ropes along frictionless surfaces, accelerating toward the left. All of the boxes are identical, and the accelerations of all three systems are the same.

**Rank the tensions in the ropes.** Explain your reasoning

#### Accelerating Systems 

In both cases a spaceship is pulling two cargo pods, one empty and one full. At the instant shown, the speed of the pods and spaceships is 300 m/s, but they have different accelerations as shown. All masses are given in terms of M, the mass of an empty pod.

**Will the tension at point *S* in the tow rod be (i) *greater in Case A*, (ii) *greater in Case B*, or (iii) *the same in both cases?*** Find the tension in each rope to help.

In each case shown below, a box is sliding along a horizontal surface. There is friction between the box and the horizontal surface. The box is tied to a hanging stone by a massless rope running over a massless, frictionless pulley. All these cases are identical except for the different initial velocities of the boxes.
