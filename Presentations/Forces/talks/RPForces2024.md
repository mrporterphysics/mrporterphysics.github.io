# **Forces** & Newton's Laws <!--fit--->

## 2024-25 Regents Physics

### A casual model for **motion**

---

<!---_class: default--->

# What is a **Force**?
- An interaction between two objects
- Forces are the cause for differing motion

---

# Motion is a result of **all forces** acting on an object. 

---

# Pivot - Balanced vs. **Unbalanced** Forces <!--fit--->

## How does motion differ when forces are balances vs. unbalanced?

---

# Newton's First Law

# Balanced Forces

- Net force = 0
- Object either:
  - Stays at rest
  - Continues at constant speed

---
# Unbalanced Forces

- Net force ‚â† 0  
- Object:
  - Speeds up
  - Slows down
  - Changes direction


---
# Newton's First Law (Inertia)

* ## **Inertia** is an object's resistance to _changes_ in its state of motion


* ## The amount of inertia is based solely on its **mass**

---
# Mass and Inertia
- Mass = amount of matter
- More mass = more inertia
- Example:
  - Harder to start/stop heavy cart
  - Easier to start/stop light cart

# Pre-Conceptions 

Students typically have many pre-conceived notions regarding concepts in Physics. It has always proven useful to bring these ideas to the forefront of your mind and to make an effort to evaluate their correctness. The following statements pertain in one way or another to common notions regarding central concepts of this unit. Identify each statement as being either true (T) or false (F).

# Mini Experiment: **Mass vs. Weight**

## Objective: 

#### **_Determine the mathematical relationship between mass and weight using a spring scale._**

### Notes:

- Don't forget a diagram of your setup 
- Include units in your measurements
- Will need graph and equation for line of best fit

---

The diagram to the right shows a 3 kg mass attached to spring scales on Earth, Mars, and Earth's Moon. Use the information in the diagram to calculate the gravitational field strength ($g$) for each Celestial Body.

Reminder:

$$\boxed{g = \frac{F_g}{m}}$$
