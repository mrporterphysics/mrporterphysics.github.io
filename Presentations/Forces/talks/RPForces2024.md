# Forces & Newton's Laws

## 2024-25 Regents Physics

### A casual model for **motion**

---

# What is a Force?
- A push or pull on an object
- Can change an object's:
  - Speed
  - Direction
  - Shape
---
# Types of Forces
- Gravity
- Friction
- Normal force (push of surfaces)
- Applied forces (pushes/pulls)
---
# Balanced Forces
- Forces that **cancel out**  
- Net force = 0
- Object either:
  - Stays at rest
  - Continues at constant speed
---
# Example: Tug of War (Balanced)
```
‚Üê100N   [üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüî¥üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è]   100N‚Üí
```
- Equal forces in opposite directions
- Rope doesn't move
---
# Unbalanced Forces
- Forces that **don't cancel out**
- Net force ‚â† 0  
- Object:
  - Speeds up
  - Slows down
  - Changes direction
---
# Example: Tug of War (Unbalanced)
```
‚Üê100N   [üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüî¥üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è]   150N‚Üí
```
- Stronger force to right
- Net force = 50N right
- Rope moves right
---
# Newton's First Law (Inertia)
- Objects resist changes in motion
- Without forces:
  - Still objects stay still
  - Moving objects keep moving
---
# Mass and Inertia
- Mass = amount of matter
- More mass = more inertia
- Example:
  - Harder to start/stop heavy cart
  - Easier to start/stop light cart
---
# Lab: Pass the Water
Let's explore inertia by:
1. Setting up cups of water
2. Testing how objects resist motion
3. Connecting mass to inertia
