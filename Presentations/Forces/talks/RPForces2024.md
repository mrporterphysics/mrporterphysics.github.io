# **Forces** & Newton's Laws <!--fit--->

## 2024-25 Regents Physics

### A casual model for **motion**

---

<!---_class: default--->

# What is a **Force**?
- An interaction between two objects
- Forces are the cause for differing motion

---

# Motion is a result of **all forces** acting on an object. 

---

# Pivot - Balanced vs. **Unbalanced** Forces <!--fit--->

## How does motion differ when forces are balances vs. unbalanced?

---

# Newton's First Law

# Balanced Forces

- Net force = 0
- Object either:
  - Stays at rest
  - Continues at constant speed

---
# Unbalanced Forces

- Net force ‚â† 0  
- Object:
  - Speeds up
  - Slows down
  - Changes direction


---
# Newton's First Law (Inertia)

* ## **Inertia** is an object's resistance to _changes_ in its state of motion


* ## The amount of inertia is based solely on its **mass**

---
# Mass and Inertia
- Mass = amount of matter
- More mass = more inertia
- Example:
  - Harder to start/stop heavy cart
  - Easier to start/stop light cart
