# Try It...

![bg fit right:45%](../figures/troy.png)

Mr. Porter and his wife walk from Nighthawks to Troy Savings Bank Music Hall. They walk 6 blocks East and then 2 Blocks South. [1 Block = 100 Meters]

1. Determine the **distance** that they traveled.
2. Determine their  **displacement**.

# Vctor Quantities:

### A *<u>vector</u>* is a quantity with both **magnitude** (size) and **direction**.

#### Examples:

  - The child was displaced 9 meters North.
  - The car has a velocity of 10 meters per second East
  - $\vec{F}$, $\vec{p}$, $\vec{a}$, $\vec{v}$, $\Delta \vec{x}$, etc

---

# Scalar Quantities

### A *<u>scalar</u>* is a quantity with just **magnitude**.


#### Examples

  - The child traveled a distance of 12 meters
  - The car is moving 20 miles per hour
  - The frog has mass of 0.5 kg.
  - $m$, $t$, $r$, etc

# Vector Components

* Parts of a two-dimensional vector
* The *component* of a vector is the influence of that vector in a given direction.
    * i.e. How far _East_ of a North East displacement did you walk?
* We look at the ***perpendicular components***
    * How much of the vector is in the *x-direction*
    * How much of the vector is in the *y-direction*
* Vector $\vec{A}$ is made up of components $\vec{A}_x$ and $\vec{A}_y$
    * $\vec{A} = \vec{A}_x + \vec{A}_y$

---

# Vector Components Math


<div class = "columns">

<div>

- Notice this is a right triangle
    * $\vec{A}^2 = \vec{A}_x^2 + \vec{A}_y^2$
    * Depending on the angle...
        * $A_x = \pm A \cos \theta$
        * $A_y = \pm A \sin \theta$

## Adding Vectors 

Vectors are added ___"tip to tail"___, that is redraw the vectors so that the tip of one vector is attached to the tail of the second vector. 

$$\vec{s} = \vec{a} + \vec{b}$$

>_The **resultant** vector S is equal to the addition of vectors a and b_

# Adding Vectors 

Mr. Porter's brother is on a hike. He walks:

- 2 KM North
- 3 KM East 
- 5 KM Exactly South East 


**Draw a the vector addition diagram** to represent this motion

## Adding Vectors 


#### Using Components


You can sum the components of the two vectors to find the components of the **resultant** vector 

* $s_x = a_x + b_x$
* $s_y = a_y + b_y$
* $s = \sqrt{s_x^2 + s_y^2 }$

# Mallet Ball

### We are going to try and recreate constant velocity motion with objects moving over smooth, hard, level surfaces.

* First with a bowling ball,
* then with with fan carts

### Bowling Ball Situations - Using a mallet and a bowling ball:

Each time we use the mallet, let it bounce. (Donâ€™t use the mallet like a bulldozer.)

* Start with a stationary bowling ball. Then, speed up the bowling ball from rest.
* Have someone roll a bowling ball. Then, bring it to a stop.
* Have someone roll a bowling ball. Then, keep it moving at a constant velocity.
* Have someone roll a bowling ball. With one tap, have the bowling ball make a 90 degree turn.

**Your goal: summarize the relation between taps and motion in as few statments as possible**

# Lab Safety: 

1. No High Mallets 
2. Be aware of your surroundings 
3. No excessive rolls 
4. No smashing into walls, mats, classmates, etc.
