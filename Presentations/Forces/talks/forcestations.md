# Station Instructions

---

## Station 1: Block on Ramp
**Setup**: Block on adjustable ramp with protractor
**Task**: Find minimum coefficient of static friction

**Equipment**:
- Wooden block
- Adjustable ramp
- Protractor (plastic or app on your phone)
- Electronic Balance

### *Extensions*:
1. Find maximum coefficient of static friction
2. Solve without mass measurement

---

## Station 2: Fan Cart
**Setup**: Fan cart on level track
**Task**: Determine fan force

**Equipment**:
- Fan cart & track
- Labquest & Motion Sensor 
- Electronic Balance

### *Extension*: 
1. Find fan force for each setting
2. Use known fan force to find an unknown mass

---

## Station 3: Hanging Doll
**Setup**: Doll suspended by rubber bands
**Task**: Find doll's mass

**Equipment**:
- Spring scales

## Bonus Station: Risky Business

**Setup**: Sliding person or object on level surface

**Task**: Determine coefficient of kinetic friction

**Equipment**:
- Video Analysis
- Motion Sensor
- Stop Watch
- Metersticks or long tape measure 

---

# Process & Expectations

1. One group at a station at a time
2. Do not use hints _unless you are stuck_ -> but try hints before asking me for problem-solving help.
3. If/when finished early:
    - choose between extension options at the different stations
    - OR solve [Risky Business](#bonus-station-risky-business-1) station
    - if you finish one go to the other

### Station 1 Hints
1. Consider forces parallel to ramp
3. Remember: $F_f = \mu F_N$

Check work from yesterdays class (packet pages 9 & 10)

---



### Station 2 Hints
1. $F_{net} = ma$
2. Measure acceleration from velocity time graph
3. What forces act horizontally?

---

### Station 3 Hints

1. Split angled forces into components
2. Remember to sum the vertical and horizontal forces
3. **Mass** and **Weight ($F_g=mg$)** are different!
