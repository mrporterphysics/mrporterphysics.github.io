# Vector Quantities:

### A *<u>vector</u>* is a quantity with both **magnitude** (size) and **direction**.

#### Examples:

  - The child was displaced 9 meters North.
  - The car has a velocity of 10 meters per second East
  - $\vec{F}$, $\vec{p}$, $\vec{a}$, $\vec{v}$, $\Delta \vec{x}$, etc

---

# Scalar Quantities

### A *<u>scalar</u>* is a quantity with just **magnitude**.


#### Examples

  - The child traveled a distance of 12 meters
  - The car is moving 20 miles per hour
  - The frog has mass of 0.5 kg.
  - $m$, $t$, $r$, etc

<div class='columns'>

- a scale is clearly listed
- a vector arrow (with arrowhead) is drawn in a specified direction. The vector arrow has a head and a tail.
- the magnitude and direction of the vector is clearly labeled. 
    - The magnitude is **20 m** and the direction is (**30 degrees _West of North_**).

# Vector Direction Conventions

1) expressed as an angle of rotation about its "tail"
    * **40 degrees North of West** (meaning a vector pointing West has been rotated 40 degrees towards the northerly direction) 
    * **65 degrees East of South** (meaning a vector pointing South has been rotated 65 degrees towards the easterly direction).
2) expressed as a counterclockwise angle of rotation about its "tail"
    * 30 degrees is a vector that has been rotated 30 degrees in a counterclockwise direction relative to due east
    *  160 degrees is a vector that has been rotated 160 degrees in a counterclockwise direction relative to due east

# The Magnitude of a Vector

![center](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/vectors/u3l1a8.gif)

- Magnitude of a vector is scaled in the vector diagram by the **length** of the arrow
- This can be scaled (i.e. 1 cm = 5 miles)

Vectors are added ___"tip to tail"___, that is redraw the vectors so that the tip of one vector is attached to the tail of the second vector. 

$$\vec{C} = \vec{a} + \vec{b}$$

# Vector Components

* Parts of a two-dimensional vector
* The *component* of a vector is the influence of that vector in a given direction.
    * i.e. How far _East_ of a North East displacement did you walk?
* We look at the ***perpendicular components***
    * How much of the vector is in the *x-direction*
    * How much of the vector is in the *y-direction*
* Vector $\vec{A}$ is made up of components $\vec{A}_x$ and $\vec{A}_y$
    * $\vec{A} = \vec{A}_x + \vec{A}_y$

---

# Vector Components Math


<div class = "columns">

<div>

- Notice this is a right triangle
    * $\vec{A}^2 = \vec{A}_x^2 + \vec{A}_y^2$
    * Depending on the angle...
        * $A_x = \pm A \cos \theta$
        * $A_y = \pm A \sin \theta$

#### Using Components


You can sum the components of the two vectors to find the components of the **resultant** vector 

If $\vec{C} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$...

* $C_x = A_x + B_x$
* $C_y = A_y + B_y$
* $|C| = \sqrt{C_x^2 + C_y^2 }$

### Adding Perpendicular Vectors

Mac and Tosh are doing the Vector Walk Lab. Starting at the door of their physics classroom, they walk 2.0 meters, south. They make a right hand turn and walk 16.0 meters, west. They turn right again and walk 24.0 meters, north. They then turn left and walk 36.0 meters, west. What is the magnitude of their overall displacement?

# Vector Treasure Hunt ü™ô

1. Create a Vector Map (draw this on the map of the school) -> start at one of the entrances of the school.
2. Record all vectors in component form and Magnitude-direction from (use the convention degrees clockwise from North...this is the setting your iPhone compass uses)
3. Exchange vector directions with another group and draw their vector map on your grid in another color or symbol (i.e. dotted line)
4. Calculate the displacement of the the vector map
5. Go walk the map and record the landmarks at the end of each vector.

# Free Fall 

## An object in **free fall** experiences *only* the force of gravity.

* This means that is accelerates at $g$ which is referred to as "_acceleration due to gravity_" or "_gravitational field strength_
* Units N/kg and m/s/s are the ***same***

# Free Fall Facts

## $a = g = -9.8 \text{ m/s/s}$ &rarr; Always when near the surface of the Earth

---

# Free Fall Facts
## If object is _dropped_ $v_i = 0$ 

---

# Free Fall Facts
## If object is projected upwards it will slow down as it rises. The y-velocity will be zero at its heights point or peak

### You can treat $v_f =0$ at the peak
    
---

# Free Fall Facts

## If an object is projected upwards the velocity at which it is projected is equal and magnitude and opposite in direction when it returns to its initial height. 

### i.e. a ball projected upwards at $+30 \text{m/s}$ will have a downward velocity of $-30 \text{m/s}$ when it returns to its launch height

---

# Problem-Solving Process

1) Draw a diagram/picture of physical situation
2) Sketch Physics motion graphs (XT & VT)
3) Fill out cross diagram with givens and unknowns 
    - (remember $a = g = -9.8 \text{ m/s/s}$ for all free fall questions)
4) Identify equation with cross diagram
5) Substitute and solve

- If object is _dropped_ $v_{iy} = 0$ 
- If object is projected upwards it will slow down as it rises. The y-velocity will be zero at its heights point or peak
    - You can treat $v_{fy} =0$ at the peak
- If an object is projected upwards the velocity at which it is projected is equal and magnitude and opposite in direction when it returns to its initial height. 
    - i.e. a ball projected upwards at $+30 \text{m/s}$ will have a downward velocity of $-30 \text{m/s}$ when it returns to its launch height
