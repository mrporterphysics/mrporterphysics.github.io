# Rotational Position $\theta$ (theta)

The **rotational position** **$\theta$** of a point on a rotating object (sometimes called angular position) is defined as an angle in the counterclockwise direction between a reference line (usually the positive x-axis) and a line drawn from the axis of rotation to that point. The units of rotational position can be either degrees or radians.

# Measuring Angular Position & Displacement

* $\Delta s$ ‚û°Ô∏è arc length (distance)
* $r$ ‚û°Ô∏è radius
* $\Delta \theta$ ‚û°Ô∏è angular displacement

## Radians 

- Angular values are most often measured in **radians**

# Radian Visualization

# Some Common Radian measurements: 

- 1 rad = rotate the radius of the circle 
- $\pi$ rad = 1/2 rotation 
- $2\pi$ = 1 rotation 
- $\frac{\pi}{3}$ = 60$^\circ$
- $\frac{\pi}{6}$ = 30$^\circ$

---

# Why use radians?

## Because it makes it easy to convert from angular values to linear equivalents

### If 

$$\Delta \theta = \frac{s}{r}$$

### Then 

$$ s = r \Delta \theta$$

# Try representing ‚åö

Your analog watch with hour and minute hand reads 3:30. What is the rotational position of each of these hands?
(Use a reference line from the axis of rotation through the 12:00 position. Assume that the hour hand points directly at the 3.)

# Rotational Velocity $\omega$ (omega)

The ***average rotational velocity*** (sometimes called ***angular velocity***) of a turning rigid body is the ratio its change in rotational position $\Delta \theta$ and the time interval $\Delta t$ needed for that change:

$$\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}$$

The sign of $\omega$ (omega) is positive for counterclockwise turning and negative for clockwise turning, as see looking along the axis of rotation. *Rotational (angular) speed* is the magnitude of the rotational velocity. The most common units for rotational velocity and speed are radians per second (rad/s) and revolutions per minute (rpm).

# Angular vs. Linear (Tangential) Velocity

# Translating Between Angular and Linear Velocity 

$$v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$$

Remember, $\Delta \theta = \frac{\Delta s}{r}$, 
so we can substitute in $\Delta s = \Delta \theta r$, 
which gives...

$$v = \frac{r \Delta s}{\Delta t} =r \omega$$

# Rotational Acceleration 

The average ***rotational acceleration $\alpha$*** (alpha) of a rotating rigid body (sometimes called ***angular acceleration***) is its change in rotational velocity $\Delta \omega$ during a time interval $\Delta t$ divided by that time interval:

$$a = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}$$

The unit of rotational acceleration is (rad/s)/s = rad/s$^2$

# Rotational Motion Graphs 

- Same idea and concepts as Linear Motion:
  * Position $(\theta)$ vs. Time Slope = Velocity $(\omega)$
  * Velocity $(\omega)$ vs. Time Slope = Acceleration $(\alpha)$
  * Area of Velocity $(\omega)$ vs. Time = Displacement $(\Delta \theta)$
