# Some New Tools 🧰 🛠️ <!--fit-->

---

# Video Upload 📹

1. Record video with you phone 📱
2. Sign into Pivot and Upload Video 📤
3. Scale to something in video to known size 📏
4. Use Built in tools ⏱️

## Tips:

- Take video perpendicular to motion
- Keep video device as still has possible (i.e. put on something, don't hold in hands)

# Spark Timer 🎇

1. Tape spark tape to object
2. Pick time setting 
3. Turn on timer & object and send it

# Essential Questions 🤔

## *Does your object **change** its **velocity***?


## *If it does change velocity, does the **velocity change constantly***?

- What evidence do you need to collect to answer these questions?

# Finding Velocity from Position time Graphs 

❗ Reminder: the slope at a specific time on a position vs. time graph is the **instantaneous velocity** of an object

🤔 How do we find the slope of a curve?

# Pivot & Rate of Change 

Pivot will calculate these slopes for you with its **rate of change** function. We can accomplish it with a calculated column


**NOTE**: This only works when time intervals are the same (i.e. time between samples is 0.1 s)

Calculates slope over three data points and assigns that value to the middle time.

# Create a **Velocity vs. Time** Graph from your Data <!--fit--->

# From your **Velocity vs. Time** Graph...

## *Does your object **change** its **velocity***?


## *If it does change velocity, does the **velocity change constantly***?


- What does the slope represent? 
- What does the intercept represent?

# What about Position and Time?

## What is the relationship betwen position and time?

## How do we know what curve to pick??
