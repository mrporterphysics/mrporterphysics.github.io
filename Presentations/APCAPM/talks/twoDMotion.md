# Freefall

* An object in **freefall** is on object which is only acted on by the force of gravity
* Therefore, it accelerates at $g$ 
* $g$ is known as _the acceleration due to gravity_ 
* But is best to be called ***gravitational field strength***
* Direction of $g$ is towards the center of the planet (down)

---

# Value of $g$ 

* On Earth it is about $9.8$ m/s$^2$
* This varies based on your distance from the center of the Earth, but doesn't vary much beyond $9.78$ to $9.83$ m/s$^2$. 
* On **quizzes and test** <u>including the AP Exam</u> we will round this to $10$ m/s$^2$ to allow for faster calculations. 
    * You will not be marked incorrect for using 9.8 m/s$^2$
* Physics Classroom website, which I often use for HW will use 9.8 m/s$^2$

# Freefall Problems 

1. A ball is released from rest from an elevated position and free-falls towards the ground. Assuming negligible air resistance, what is the ball's speed after 4.5 seconds?
2. A ball is released from rest from an elevated position and free-falls towards the ground. If it strikes the ground after 3.0 seconds, then what was the height from which the ball was released? Assume negligible air resistance.
3. A tennis ball cannon projects a ball vertically upward with an initial speed of 50 m/s. Assuming negligible air resistance, with what speed will the ball be moving after 3.0 seconds.

# Freefall Problems (cont.)

4. A tennis ball cannon projects a ball vertically upward with an initial speed of 40 m/s. Assuming negligible air resistance, how much time does it take for the ball to reach its highest position?
5. A tennis ball cannon projects a ball vertically upward with an initial speed of 68 m/s. Assuming negligible air resistance, how much time does it take for the ball to travel up and back down to its launch height?
