#Mustache Questions:
--

##How are you doing today?
--

##Have you tried the practice test application for the AP Exam?
--

##What is the best takeout you've had during social distancing?

---

#Force Definitions:

- A ***force*** is an interaction between two objects.
  - Individual forces can measured with platform scales, spring scales, or force sensors (which are just fancy spring scales)
  - Units are Netwons which are kilogram*meter/sec/sec
--

- Forces acting in the same direction add together to determine the net force.
- Forces acting in opposite directions subtract to determine the net force.
--

- The net force is always in the direction of acceleration.
--

- The ***net force*** on an object is the single force that could replace all the individual forces acting on an object and produce the same effect.

---

#Different Common Forces:

###Mass vs. Weight (Force of Gravity `\(F_g\)`)

- Mass tells how much material is contained in an object.
--

- The units of mass are kilograms.
--

- Weight is the force of a planet acting on an object.
--

- On earth‚Äôs surface, the gravitational field is 10 N/kg.  This means that on earth, 1 kg of mass weighs 10 N.

---

#Different Common Forces:

- Force of Grvity or Weight: Interaction between two objects with mass. Given by `\(F_g = mg\)` or `\(F_g = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\)`
--

- Normal Force: the perpendicular force. A force that occurs when two objects are in contact with each other and the surfaces deform.
--

- Friction Force: force of the surface on an object. Acts parellel to the surface opposite the direction that the object is moving or attempting to move:
  - Kinetic: surfaces are sliding relative to one another.
  - Static: surfaces aren't moving relative to one another.
  - Coefficient of friction (`\(\mu\)`): number that tells you how sticky the two surfaces in contact are.
--

- Tension Force: String/rope/chain/etc is stretched. Force is along the stretched object.
--

- Spring Force (`\(F_s = kx\)`): Force that occurs when a spring is stretched or compressed. Force is opposite of spring displacement and proportional in magnitude to the displacement.

---

#Mass Types:

- ***Gravitational mass*** is measured by measuring an object‚Äôs weight using `\(weight = mg\)`
- ***Inertial mass*** is measured by measuring the net force on an object, measuring the object‚Äôs acceleration, and using `\(F_{net} = ma\)`.
--

Note: AP Wants you to know this...to this date it has not been found that gravitational mass and inertial mass differ experimentally.

---

#Newton's First Law

- Balanced Forces (no net force) results in constant velocity (zero or non-zero)
--

- Unbalanced Forces (net force) results in Acceleration

---

#Newton's Second Law

- Mathematical Equation for 1st law.

$$ a = \frac{\Sigma F}{m} $$

--

or

--

$$\Sigma F = ma$$

---

#Newton's Third Law

- Forces are interactions between *two* objects, therefore forces come in pairs, these pairs are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
--

- ***Although the force pairs must be equal, the forces can have different effects based on the different masses of the objects.***

---

#Forces at an angle

- Any diagonal force can be written in terms of two perpendicular force components, called the x- and y- components.
--

- To determine the amount of each component, you can draw the diagonal force to scale.  Draw dotted lines from the tip of the force arrow directly to the x- and y- axes.  Measure each component.
--

- When the angle `\(\theta\)` of the diagonal force is measured from the horizontal,
  - The horizontal component of the force is  `\(F\cos\theta \)`
  - The vertical component of the force is  `\(F\sin\theta \)`

---

#Representing Forces with Free Body Diagrams:

A free-body diagram includes:

1. A labeled arrow representing each force.  Each arrow begins on the object and points in the direction in which the force acts.
2. A list of the forces, indicating the object applying the force and the object experiencing the force.

---

#Inclined Planes

When an object is on an inclined plane, break the object‚Äôs weight into components parallel to and perpendicular to the incline.  Do not use x and y axes.

- The component of the object‚Äôs weight parallel to the incline is `\(mg\sin\theta\)`
- The component of the object‚Äôs weight perpendicular to the incline is `\(mg\cos\theta\)`


---

---

#Solving Force Problems:


1. Draw a free-body diagram.
1. If any force acts at an angle, break it into components.
1. Determine the net force in each direction, even if that net force is an expression with unknown variables in it.
2. Write two equations (note if the object has *constant velocity* `\(a = 0\)`):
  - `\(\Sigma F_y = ma_y\)` in the vertical direction
  - `\(\Sigma F_x = ma_x \)` in the the horizontal direction

--

*If you are asked to analyze forces on the exam, draw a FBD on scrap paper!*

---

#Turning to Rotation

##Quick Definitions:

- Centripetal Acceleration is the name given to an object's acceleration towards the center of a circle.
--

- Torque occurs when a force applied to an object could cause the object to rotate
--

- The lever arm for a force is the closest distance to the fulcrum, pivot, or axis of rotational to the line on which the force acts.

---

#Circular Motion:

- Objects moving at constant *speed* in a circular path accelerate because they are changing their *direction* of motion.

$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
--

You can find the speed by dividing the circumference (`\(2\pi r \)`) by the period `\(T\)` (the time of one complete circle)

$$ \bar{v} = \frac{d}{t}= \frac{2\pi r}{T}$$

---

#Centripetal Force

‚ÄúCentripetal force‚Äù is not a new type of force, it is a name given to other forces when they cause objects to move in circular paths. (Example - cars travel around curves because friction provides a centripetal force)

---

#Circular Motion:

Uniform Circular Motion occurs when objects rotate with constant speed.
  - Linear Velocity is always changing because of direction (angular velocity is constant).
  - There is centripetal acceleration but not tangential acceleration.


---

#Circular Motion

Sum of the radial forces are the centripetal force

$$\Sigma F = ma = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

---

#Planetary Motion:

Gravity can cause large objects to move in circular paths...

--

$$\Sigma F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

--

$$F_g = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$$

--

$$G\frac{Mm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

--

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$


---

#Torque:

- The rotational equivalent of force. Measures the effectiveness of a force changing or accelerating a rotation. "Twisting force"
--

- Torque is equal to force applied * lever arm
--

- The lever arm is defined as the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force.
--

$$\tau = r F \sin \theta$$
--

---

##Rotational Dynamics:

- A net torque results in an angular acceleration.
--

  - (Just like a net force results in a linear acceleration)
--

- Linear acceleration is proportional to  net force `\(a \propto F_{net}\)` and inversely proportional to mass `\(a \propto \frac{1}{m}\)`
--

- So what do you think angular acceleration is proportional to? (Other than `\(\alpha \propto \tau\)`)
--

  - What makes it easier to spin something?

---

##Rotational Inertia

- Rotational inertia `\(I\)` represents an object‚Äôs resistance to angular acceleration.
- For a point particle, rotational inertia is `\(MR^2\)`, where `\(M\)` is the particle‚Äôs mass, and `\(R\)` is the distance from the axis of rotation.
- For a complicated object, its rotational inertia may be given by an equation relating its mass and radius.  The chart on the next page from Giordano‚Äôs text should not be memorized, but used as a guide.  These equations will be given as needed.
- Rotational inertia of multiple objects add together algebraically.
