# Final Project 💻 <!---fit--->

# Spring 2023 - Coding 

### Mr. Porter

# Requirements 

* Your final program is interactive - that is, when the user runs it, they provide inputs to the program that change the final outcome. These could be text inputs, mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, anything also long as the user interacts with your program.
* You MUST add comments to your program so that your code is readable and I know what each section of code is doing for the final program. 
* The program is your original work. It doesn’t have to be an original idea (i.e. if you rebuild Tetris), but it does have to be your unique code. I will Google your code to ensure that you have not plagiarized it. This means that you cannot just simply follow a tutorial online to build a program. You must create something on your own.
* The program is something that interests you and you are excited by.
You must document the work that you completed each class from now until the end of the year. This will be your classwork grade. (7 Classes)
