# What is $\LaTeX$?

- Type setting program for professional documnets, made for scientific and mathematical documents
- Plain text file that interspersed with LaTeX commands and complied with a *TeX engine*
    - Sort of like a computer program 
    - Converts commands into a PDF File
- Not WYSIWYG like Microsoft Word or Google Docs

---

# Why use $\LaTeX$?

- support for typesetting extremely complex mathematics, tables and technical content for the physical sciences;
- facilities for footnotes, cross-referencing and management of bibliographies;
- ease of producing complicated, or tedious, document elements such as indexes, glossaries, table of contents, lists of figures;
- being highly customizable for bespoke document production due to its intrinsic programmability and extensibility through thousands of free add-on packages.

# Making your first document 

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
```

# Add in Titles

<div class="columns">

<div>

```latex 
\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\title{My first LaTeX document}
\author{Hubert Farnsworth}
\date{August 2022}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
We have now added a title, author and 
date to our first \LaTeX{} document!

```latex 
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{images/}}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{mesh}
    \caption{A nice plot.}
    \label{fig:mesh1}

As you can see in figure \ref{fig:mesh1}, 
the function grows near the origin. This 
example is on page \pageref{fig:mesh1}.

### Display Math

```latex
\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\begin{document}
The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation \[ E=mc^2 \] discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 

In natural units ($c = 1$), the formula expresses the identity
\begin{equation}
E=m

# Poster Day

##### **❓of the 📅**: Summer time! 🏖️ or ⛰️ vacation? What do you want to learn about yourself this summer? What are you most looking forward to this summer?

## Poster Procedures 📋:

- **One member** of your group should be at your poster at **all times** (exception: if you worked alone). **Rotate** who this is. 
- **Visit all posters** and ask presenter questions about their project
    - "_What do you learn_" or "_What would you change if you were to do this again?_" or "_What is your most interesting fining?_"
    - Do no crowd any poster, spread out, go to posters with fewer people and rotate around the room
