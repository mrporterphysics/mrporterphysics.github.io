# What is $\LaTeX$?

- Type setting program for professional documnets, made for scientific and mathematical documents
- Plain text file that interspersed with LaTeX commands and complied with a *TeX engine*
    - Sort of like a computer program 
    - Converts commands into a PDF File
- Not WYSIWYG like Microsoft Word or Google Docs

---

# Why use $\LaTeX$?

- support for typesetting extremely complex mathematics, tables and technical content for the physical sciences;
- facilities for footnotes, cross-referencing and management of bibliographies;
- ease of producing complicated, or tedious, document elements such as indexes, glossaries, table of contents, lists of figures;
- being highly customizable for bespoke document production due to its intrinsic programmability and extensibility through thousands of free add-on packages.

# Making your first document 

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
```

# Add in Titles

<div class="columns">

<div>

```latex 
\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\title{My first LaTeX document}
\author{Hubert Farnsworth}
\date{August 2022}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
We have now added a title, author and 
date to our first \LaTeX{} document!
\end{document}
```

# **Bold,** *Italics*, <u>Underline</u>

```latex
Some of the \textbf{greatest}
discoveries in \underline{science} 
were made by \textbf{\textit{accident}}.

# Add Figures

<div class="columns">

<div>

```latex 
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{images/}}
 
\begin{document}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{mesh}
    \caption{A nice plot.}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}
 
As you can see in figure \ref{fig:mesh1}, 
the function grows near the origin. This 
example is on page \pageref{fig:mesh1}.

\end{document}

# Adding Math

## Inline Math

In in the middle of a block of text:

```latex
\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\begin{document}
In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
\end{document}
```

In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated by the equation $E = mc^2$

# Adding Math 

### Display Math

```latex
\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
\begin{document}
The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation \[ E=mc^2 \] discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 

In natural units ($c = 1$), the formula expresses the identity
\begin{equation}
E=m
\end{equation}

# More Math Things 🧮

- for sub and superscripts we use _ and ^ 
    - $E = mc^2$ `E = mc^2`
    - $F_N$ `F_N` or $F_{normal}$ `F_{normal}`
- Fractions
    - $a = \frac{\Sigma \vec{F}}{m}$ `a = \frac{\Sigma \vec{F}}{m}` `\frac{num}{dem}`
- Trig:
    - $\sin\theta \cos\theta \tan\theta$ `\sin\theta \cos\theta \tan\theta`
