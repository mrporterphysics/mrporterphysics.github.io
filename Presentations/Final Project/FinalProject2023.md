# Ideas...

<div class="columns">

<div>

- What is the Best Paper Airplane Design?
- Ben Scott Ping Pong Ball Accelerator
- Calculate the Speed of Light using multiple methods (i.e. chocolate bar and microwave)
- Are cars speeding on Maple Hill Road?
- Create a physics simulation with computer code
- Water music - create a musical instrument





</div>

<div>

- Mentos and Coca-Cola…(remember you need to collect some sort of data!)
- Determine the properties of a water balloon slingshot so that you can hit a target (maybe Mr. Porter?)
- Circuits Experiments
- Arduino Experiments
- Optics Experiments (i.e. Focal Length of lenses...how do glasses work?)
- Recreate an AP Exam Experimental Design Question
