# Motion 🚗 <!--fit--->

## A Descriptive *Model* for Particles 

### Physics with Mr. Porter


---

* A ***constant velocity***
    * means that it changed its *position* equal amounts for each equal change in *time*
* ***Velocity*** ($\bar{v}$) is represented by the *slope* of the position vs. time graph
    * how "fast"
    * AND what direction
* ***Speed*** is the steepness of the slope:
    * it tells us the rate that position changes with time
    * steeper slope == faster
* The **initial position** ($x_0$ or $y_0$) of the object is the vertical intercept
    *  it tells us where the object is at clock reading 0.

---

# Mathematical Models 

#### General Mathematical Mode:

$$x = \bar{v}t + x_0$$

$$\textrm{position} = (\textrm{velociy})*\textrm{time}+ \textrm{initial position}$$


#### Specific Mathematical Model (example):

$$x = (25 \textrm{ cm/s})t + 250 \textrm{ cm}$$


#### Narrative Model:

*"The toy car started at a position of 250 cm and moved in the positive direction at a speed of 25 cm/s."*

### Displacement

- Change in position of an object
- $\Delta x = x_f - x_0$
- Includes direction

### Distance

- the **magnitude** (or size) of displacement between two positions
- more often referred to as **distance traveled** which is the total length of the path traveled between two positions

### Position
- Where an object is at any particular time
- "Location"

# Describing Motion 

Each description should include:

* Starting position
* Direction of motion (positive direction, no motion, or negative direction)
* Type of motion (at rest, constant velocity, speeding up, slowing down or some combination of these)
* Relative speed (slow, medium, fast, slower, faster—this is only meaningful with there is more than one part of the motion or when you are comparing two or more objects)

# How Far?

## Position vs. Distance vs. Displacement

---

# Scalars vs. Vectors

* **Scalars** are quantities that are fully described by a magnitude (or numerical value) alone.
* **Vectors** are quantities that are fully described by both a magnitude and a direction.

---

# Distance and Displacement


* **Distance** is a **scalar quantity** that refers to "how much ground an object has covered" during its motion.
* **Displacement** is a **vector quantity** that refers to "how far out of place an object is"; it is the object's overall change in position.

---

# Example

A physics teacher walks 4 meters East, 2 meters South, 4 meters West, and finally 2 meters North.

- Distance = 4 m + 2 m + 4 m + 2 m = 12 m
- Displacement = 0 (didn't change position!)

Consider a football coach pacing back and forth along the sidelines. The diagram below shows several of coach's positions at various times. At each marked position, the coach makes a "U-turn" and moves in the opposite direction. In other words, the coach moves from position A to B to C to D.
 

What is the coach's resulting displacement and distance of travel?

What is the coach's resulting displacement and distance of travel? 

The coach covers a distance of

(35 yds + 20 yds + 40 yds) = 95 yards
and has a displacement of 55 yards, left.

$$ v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

- $v$ -> velocity
- $\Delta x$ -> displacement
- $\Delta t$ -> time duration, or change in time

# Calculating Average Acceleration 

$$ \bar{a} = \frac{\Delta \text{velocity}}{\text{time}} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}$$

## Example

$$ \bar{a} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{50 \text{ m/s} - 0 \text{ m/s}}{5 \text{ s}} = \frac{10 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ s}}$$ 

### Units

- m/s/s or m/s$^2$
- mi/hr/s
- km/hr/s

---

# Direction of Acceleration 

* When an object is **speeding up** the velocity and acceleration are in the **same direction**
    - v (+) and a (+)
    - v (-) and a (-)
*   When an object is **slowing down** the velocity and acceleration are in the **opposite direction**
    - v (+) and a (-)
    - v (-) and a (+)

# Area of VT Graph 

- Area "under the curve" represents the displacement (*change in position*) of the object. 
- Areas can be negative because that represents the direction

$$ \Delta x = \bar{v}{t} $$

- Add multiple segments together, including the sign to get the total displacement of a piecewise motion

### VT Graphs 

1. Draw the velocity vs. time graph for an object whose motion produced the position vs. time graphs shown below.
2. For many graphs, both the ***slope*** and ***area*** between the line and the horizontal axis have physical meanings. What does the ***slope*** of the position vs. time graph tell you about the motion of an object?
