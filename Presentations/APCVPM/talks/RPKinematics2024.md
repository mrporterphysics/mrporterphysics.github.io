# Toy Buggy Observations üöó 

## In your lab notebook write down 2 of the following... 

- üëÄ what do you see? (observations)
- ü§î what do you think? (hypotheses)
- üí≠ what do you wonder? (what questions could you ask to support hypotheses)

# Buggy Lab üöó

## Objective: 

* Determine if your toy buggy moves in a <U>consistent manner</u> by developing a relationship between ***position*** and ***time***. 

## Notes
* Use ***time*** as your independent variable

# Lab Results:

* The buggies moved with a ***constant velocity***
    * means that it changed its *position* equal amounts for each equal change in *time*
* ***Velocity*** ($\bar{v}$) is represented by the *slope* of the position vs. time graph
    * how "fast"
    * AND what direction
* ***Speed*** is the steepness of the slope:
    * it tells us the rate that position changes with time
    * steeper slope == faster
* The **initial position** ($x_0$ or $y_0$) of the object is the vertical intercept
    *  it tells us where the object is at clock reading 0.

# Mathematical Models 

#### General Mathematical Mode:

$$x = \bar{v}t + x_0$$


#### Specific Mathematical Model (example):

$$x = (25 \textrm{ cm/s})t + 250 \textrm{ cm}$$


#### Narrative Model:

*"The toy car started at a position of 250 cm and moved in the positive direction at a speed of 25 cm/s."*

# Vector vs. Scalar 

<div class='columns'>

<div>

## Vector 

* Physical Quantity that describes *magnitude* (size) and *direction*
* indicated with an ‚û°Ô∏è above the symbol
    * i.e. $\vec{v}$ or $\vec{p}$ or $\Delta\vec{x}$
</div>

<div>

## Scalar 

* Physical quantity that describes the *magnitude* (size) of something


</div>
</div>

### Displacement

- Change in position of an object
- $\Delta x = x_f - x_0$
- Includes direction (***vector quantity***)

### Distance

- the **magnitude** (or size) of displacement between two positions (***scalar quantity***)
- more often referred to as **distance traveled** which is the total length of the path traveled between two positions

### Position
- Where an object is at any particular time in coordinate system (***vector***)
- "Location"

---

# Speed vs. Velocity:

* **Velocity** is a ***vector*** quantity
    - how fast and what direction
* **Speed** is a ***scalar*** quantity
    - how fast

# Describing Motion 

Each description should include:
- Starting position
- Direction of motion (positive direction, no motion, or negative direction)
- Type of motion (at rest, constant velocity, speeding up, slowing down or some combination of these)
- Relative speed (slow, medium, fast, slower, faster‚Äîthis is only meaningful with there is more than
one part of the motion or when you are comparing two or more objects)

# Motion Maps Notes

- The numberline is the **position** of the object
- The separation of the dots and length of the arrow represents the **velocity** of the object

# Analyzing Position-Time (XT) Graphs

### For the following position vs. time graph, consider the positive direction to be north.

1. When is the object moving North? South?
3. When is the object stopped?
4. When is the object North of the origin?
5. What is the velocity of the object at $t = 1$ s? $t = 2.5$ s? $t = 4$ s? When it is at the origin?

# Average vs. Instantaneous

* **Average** - what is something over a period of time, $\Delta t$ 
* **Instantaneous** - what is something at that exact moment in time, $t$

# Velocity vs. Speed

## Velocity

$$ \bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{\textrm{displacement}}{\textrm{time duration}}$$

## Speed 

$$ |v| = \frac{\textrm{distance}}{\Delta t}$$

---

# Instantaneous Values:

- _"at that moment"_
- Value at a specific time 

## Instantaneous Velocity

- Velocity at a specific time
- The slope of the position vs. time graph ***at that time measurement***


## Instantaneous Speed

- Magnitude of the velocity

# A racecar reaches a speed of **95** m/s after it is **450** meters past the starting line. If the car travels at a constant speed of **95** m/s for the next **12.5** seconds, how far will the care be from the starting line?

## Mr. H waits patiently as two beetles race across the **35.8**-cm length of the cereal box. According to Mr. H's estimates, Beetle A averages **0.230** cm/s and Beetle B averages **0.454** cm/s. Beetle A has a **4.1**-cm 'head start' (when Beetle B is at the far edge of the box). What is the separation distance (in cm) between beetles when the first beetle reaches the end of the box?

2. For many graphs, both the ***slope*** and ***area*** between the line and the horizontal axis have physical meanings. What does the ***slope*** of the position vs. time graph tell you about the motion of an object?

# VT Graphs

4. Looking at the velocity vs. time graphs, determine the units for a square of area on the graph. 
5. What does the "*area under the velocity-time graph*" tell you about the motion of the object?

---

# Area of VT Graph 

- Area "under the curve" represents the displacement (*change in position*) of the object. 
- Areas can be negative because that represents the direction

$$ \Delta x = \bar{v}{t} $$

- Add multiple segments together, including the sign to get the total displacement of a piecewise motion

![bg fit right](image.png)

# Area of VT Graph

1. Area = $\Delta x$ = $4$ m
1. Area = $\Delta x$ = $-2$ m
1. Area = $\Delta x$ =  $4$ m
