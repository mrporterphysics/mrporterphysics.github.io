## A Descriptive *Model* for Particles 

### AP Physics 2023-24 with Mr. Porter


---


# Lab Results:

* The buggies moved with a ***constant velocity***
    * means that it changed its *position* equal amounts for each equal change in *time*
* ***Velocity*** ($\bar{v}$) is represented by the *slope* of the position vs. time graph
    * how "fast"
    * AND what direction
* ***Speed*** is the steepness of the slope:
    * it tells us the rate that position changes with time
    * steeper slope == faster
* The **initial position** ($x_0$ or $y_0$) of the object is the vertical intercept
    *  it tells us where the object is at clock reading 0.

# Mathematical Models 

#### General Mathematical Mode:

$$x = \bar{v}t + x_0$$


#### Specific Mathematical Model (example):

$$x = (25 \textrm{ cm/s})t + 250 \textrm{ cm}$$


#### Narrative Model:

*"The toy car started at a position of 250 cm and moved in the positive direction at a speed of 25 cm/s."*

# CER in AP Physics:

* ***Claim***:
    * Sentence that answers the question.

* ***Evidence***:
    * Explanation of how the evidence supports the claim.
        * Should include details!
        * Refer back to the question, include any data, diagrams, or graphs.

* Reasoning:
    * Physics principle, such as an equation, law, or definition.
        * This is general, do no include specific details.
