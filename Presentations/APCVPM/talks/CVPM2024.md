### AP Physics 2024-25 with Mr. Porter

# Lab Results:

* The buggies moved with a ***constant velocity***
    * means that it changed its *position* equal amounts for each equal change in *time*
* ***Velocity*** ($\bar{v}$) is represented by the *slope* of the position vs. time graph
    * how "fast"
    * AND what direction
* ***Speed*** is the steepness of the slope:
    * it tells us the rate that position changes with time
    * steeper slope == faster
* The **initial position** ($x_0$ or $y_0$) of the object is the vertical intercept
    *  it tells us where the object is at clock reading 0.

# Mathematical Models 

#### General Mathematical Mode:

$$x = \bar{v}t + x_0$$


#### Specific Mathematical Model (example):

$$x = (25 \textrm{ cm/s})t + 250 \textrm{ cm}$$


#### Narrative Model:

*"The toy car started at a position of 250 cm and moved in the positive direction at a speed of 25 cm/s."*

### Position
- Where an object is at any particular time in coordinate system (***vector***)
- "Location"

# Pivot & Rate of Change 

Pivot will calculate these slopes for you with its **rate of change** function. We can accomplish it with a calculated column


**NOTE**: This only works when time intervals are the same (i.e. time between samples is 0.1 s)

## How do we know what curve to pick??

# Linearization 

## _Finding the linear approximation of a function_

---

# Why? 

1. Verify a certain relationship (i.e. determine if your selected curve fit is the relationship)
2. You expect your data has a certain relationship and want to determine a parameter. 
3. You are trying to find an unknown relationship between two variables. 

---

# Linearizing allows us to interpret <!--fit--->

# curves as **lines** <!--fit--->

---

# How do we change a curve into a line?

## *By making a test plot*

1. Make a new data column
2. Calculate the expected relationship in that column (i.e. if the graph looks quadratic calculate $x^2$)
3. Make a new plot (i.e. graph $y$ vs. $x^2$)
4. Analyze new linear model

# Cheat Sheet 

![center width:550](../figures/lienarize.png)

# Lab Summary 

* Slope of the Velocity vs. Time graph is ***acceleration***
* ***Acceleration*** is measured in m/s/s or m/s$^2$
* ***Slope*** of the ***Position vs. Time$^2$*** is $\frac{1}{2}$ of the ***acceleration***

---

# General Mathematical Models:

* For this lab (with no initial position or initial velocity):
  - $v_x = at$
  - $x = \frac{1}{2}at^2$

* For an object with an initial velocity and initial starting point:
  * $\boxed{v_x = v_{x0} + at}$
  * $\boxed{x = x_0 + v_{x0}t + \frac{1}{2}at^2}$

---

# Defintions & Notes


* ***Displacement*** indicates how far an object ends up from its initial position, regardless of its total distance traveled.
* ***Average velocity*** is displacement divided by the time interval over which that displacement occurred. Slope of position time graph over a time duration.
* ***Instantaneous velocity*** is how fast an object is moving at a specific moment in time. Slope of position time graph at a specific time.
* ***Acceleration*** tells how much an object‚Äôs speed changes in one second.
  - When an object speeds up, its acceleration is in the direction of motion.
  - When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite the direction of motion.

# **Position-time graphs**

* To determine how far from the detector an object is located, look at the vertical axis of the position-time graph.
* To determine how fast an object is moving, look at the steepness (i.e. the slope) of the position-time graph.
* To determine which way the object is moving, look at which way the position-time graph is sloped.
* A position-time slope like a front slash ‚ÜóÔ∏è / means the object is moving away from the detector.
* A position-time slope like a back slash ‚ÜòÔ∏è \ means the object is moving toward the detector
* Instantaneous velocity is found by taking the slope of the tangent line to a position-time graph

---


## **Velocity-time graphs**

* To determine how fast an object is moving, look at the vertical axis of the velocity-time graph.
* To determine which way the object is moving, look at whether the velocity-time graph is above or below the horizontal axis.
* An object is moving away from the detector if the velocity-time graph is above the horizontal axis.
* An object is moving toward the detector if the velocity-time graph is below the horizontal axis.
* To determine how far an object travels, determine the area between the velocity-time graph and the horizontal axis.
* On a velocity-time graph it is not possible to determine how far from the detector the object is located.
* Most everyday motion can be represented with straight segments on a velocity-time graph.

---

# Acceleration 

* Negative Acceleration **does not** always mean slowing down
* Negative Acceleration means the velocity is changing in the negative direction

---

# Acceleration: Increasing vs. Decreasing Speed 

* ***Speeding Up***: Acceleration and velocity have the ***same*** sign
* ***Slowing Down***: Acceleration and Velocity have ***opposite*** signs

# Area of VT Graph 

- Area "under the curve" represents the displacement (*change in position*) of the object. 
- Areas can be negative because that represents the direction

$$ \Delta x = \bar{v}{t} $$

- Add multiple segments together, including the sign to get the total displacement of a piecewise motion
