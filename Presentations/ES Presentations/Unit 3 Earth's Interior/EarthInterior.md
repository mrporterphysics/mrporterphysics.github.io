## Unit 3

# What happened to Krakatoa?

- Goal: Observe changing landforms after the 1883 eruption and raise questions about Earth’s systems.
- Watch: Krakatoa – The Great Volcanic Eruption (0:00–3:32) [Krakatoa – the Great Volcanic Eruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrEIT66oPqU&t=3778s)
- Task: Use a See-Think-Wonder to capture your observations, inferences, and questions.

# Engage — See-Think-Wonder

- **See:** What did you observe in the images/video of Krakatoa’s islands?
- **Think:** What do those observations make you think about how the land changed?
- **Wonder:** What questions do you have (e.g., Where did the missing islands go? Where did new ones come from)?

Tip: Write specific evidence-based observations (dates, shapes, sizes, sequences).

---

# Engage — Share and Synthesize (Domino Discover)
- In table groups, share one idea or question from your See-Think-Wonder.
- As a class: Surface common trends, key inferences, and open questions.
- Focus: Patterns of change (growth, disappearance, reappearance), possible causes, evidence you used.

---

# How do we figure out what’s underneath Earth’s surface?

- Goal: Use real earthquake data and a computational model to detect patterns in wave arrivals.
- Tools:
  - Data Visualization: [Global Seismogram Viewer](http://ds.iris.edu/gsv/)
  - Simulation: [Seismic Waves](https://ds.iris.edu/seismon/swaves/index.php?lat=38.32&lon=142.36&depth=32&mag=9&title=2011+Tohoku+Quake+%26+Tsunami&date=2011-03-11T05:46Z&w_terrain=true&wiki=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tohoku_earthquake_and_tsunami)
- Deliverable: A new See-Think-Wonder based on seismic evidence.

---

# Observing Seismic Data (2011 Japan Quake example)
- Open: Global Seismogram Viewer.
- Find: “Near East Coast of Honshu, Japan, Mag 9.1.”
- Observe: Time of wave arrivals vs. global distance to stations.
- Record: Patterns you see (steady trends, abrupt changes), citing specific traces.

Prompt: Note where arrival times change abruptly. What might cause this?

---

# Seismic Waves Simulation (Part 1)
- Open: Seismic Waves (Tohoku setup link).
- Step 1: Turn on “waves shown” and “label waves on.”
- Step 2: Select “shadow zone only,” “surface,” and “cross section.”
- Run: Watch P (primary) vs. S (secondary) waves across Earth’s interior.

Guiding Questions:
- How do P waves travel compared to S waves?
- Where do waves disappear or change speed/shape?
- What does that suggest about interior layers?

---

# Seismic Waves Simulation (Part 1, continued)
- Switch “waves shown” to “standard waves.”
- Focus: Leading edge of the P wave.
- Observe: How many times do parts of the P wave reflect/bounce? Where and why?

Record: Diagram the motion over time and annotate reflections/refractions.

---

# Density Column

---

### Explore 1 — See-Think-Wonder (Seismic + Density)
- **See:** Patterns in wave arrivals and in density layering.
- **Think:** What do these patterns imply about Earth’s structure?
- **Wonder:** What open questions could be answered next (e.g., composition, phases)?

Tip: Tie seismic evidence (P vs. S behavior, reflections) to density-based layering.

—

Slide 12: Explain 1 — What do differences in seismic waves tell us?
- Goal: Build a model of Earth’s interior using evidence about how energy drives motion of matter in P and S waves.
- Focus:
  - P waves: Longitudinal; travel through solids and liquids; change speed/reflect with layers.
  - S waves: Transverse; travel only through solids; disappear near the core.

—

Slide 13: Explain 1 — Modeling P and S Waves (Human Model)
- Observe a human-model demo (or video) of P and S wave motion. [Demonstrating P and S waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjRGIpP-Qfw&feature=emb_logo)
- Record in See-Think-Wonder:
  - **See:** How molecules move in each wave type.
  - **Think:** Why P moves through liquids/solids but S only through solids.
  - **Wonder:** What this implies about Earth’s layers.

Prompt: Connect “movement of matter” to “energy from the earthquake.”

—

Slide 14: Explain 1 — Density & Gravity (from Explore)
- Key idea: Denser materials have more mass in the same space; gravity pulls them toward Earth’s center.
- Implication: Earth’s interior layered by density (heavy metals deeper; lighter silicate rocks near surface).
- Bridge: Seismic patterns + density evidence → infer phase and composition of layers.

—

Slide 15: Explain 1 — Build Your Model of Earth’s Interior
- Model requirements:
  - At least 3 layers: solid crust, solid mantle, liquid outer core (inner core phase not determined yet).
  - Show where P and S waves do/do not propagate.
  - Indicate relative densities (denser deeper).
- Evidence labels:
  - Seismogram arrival times (abrupt changes)
  - P vs. S behavior (S shadow; P reflections)
  - Density column analogy

Deliverable: Diagram + brief written explanation tying evidence to each model feature.

—

Slide 16: Explain 1 — Class Consensus Discussion
- Steps:
  1) Selected groups present models.
  2) Peers restate; ask clarifying questions.
  3) Table confers; then whole-class agree on shared evidence-based claims.
- Target takeaways:
  - Earth has distinct interior layers.
  - P and S wave behavior reveals phase differences.
  - Layers stack by density; energy (earthquakes) drives motion of matter through them.

—

Slide 17: Exit Check (Summary Task prompts)
- In 3–5 sentences, explain how seismic evidence and density patterns support your Earth interior model.
- Identify one claim you’re most confident in and the evidence that supports it.
- Note one question you still have about Earth’s interior to explore next.
