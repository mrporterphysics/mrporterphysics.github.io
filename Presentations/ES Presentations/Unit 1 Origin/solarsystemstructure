# Structure of the Solar System 

## Regents Earth Science

### 2024-25

---

# What is an Earth-like Planet?

# **Start by looking at our Solar System**

---

# Organzie you planet cards based on their distance from the Sun. 

## 1. Find patterns in the planets data

## 2. Fill out See-Think-Wonder based on the patterns you find


---

# See-Think-Wonder

* smaller planets are closest to the Sun & larger planets are furthest
* denser planets are closest to the Sun & less dense planets are furthest
* low mass planets are closest to the Sun & high mass planets are furthest
* planet temperature decreases as you move further from the Sun
* planets near the Sun are composed of rocks and metals while planets further from the Sun are composed of ice and gas 

### What are some possible explanations for our patterns?

---

# What is density?

### Question to investigate
Do cubes of exactly the same size and shape, have the same mass?

### Expected results
_The metal cube will have a greater mass than the wood or plastic cube._

### **How can two objects, which are exactly the same size and shape, have a different mass?**
