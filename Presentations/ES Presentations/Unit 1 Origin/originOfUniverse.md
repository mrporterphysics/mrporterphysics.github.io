# Origin of the Universe 🪐 <!--fit---> 

---



## Our Earth, for 12,000 years has been an ideal place for humans and other life to evolve. Now rising global temperatures have caused sea-levels to rise, and an increase in  floods and droughts, all forcing groups of people to leave their homes  There is also a rapid decline in populations of species worldwide that many scientists are referring to as the “Sixth Mass Extinction.” Our Earth is becoming less and less welcoming due to human impact, and our population is continuing to increase! 

## What are your initial ideas for what we can do to stop what is occurring to planet Earth and ensure the survival of humans and other species?

## What can humans do to survive as a species if we are not successful in stopping the negative changes to planet Earth?

# There are a variety of species on Earth and each is adapted to live in a particular environment. As I’m sure you are aware, planet Earth has been experiencing a lot of environmental stress and scientists are concerned with how this might impact species on Earth, including humans.

# Hunting for Eath 2.0 

## If the Earth could no longer sustain human life, where could we go? Imagine that you belong to a committee of scientists that has been asked to explore the universe for an Earth like planet that may be habitable by humans. Your task is to convince the scientific community, congress, the president, your family and friends, basically the whole world, that the exoplanet you detect is worth the funding necessary to investigate it further and perhaps try to reach it one day.

<!---- Show the first two minutes and fifty seconds of the How many Planets? Video.
After watching the video, highlight for students that there are a tremendous number of planets that they can investigate, so they will have to come up with a criteria for what makes a planet Earth-like in order to narrow down the search.
