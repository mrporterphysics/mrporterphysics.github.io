### Our Earth, for 12,000 years has been an ideal place for humans and other life to evolve. Now rising global temperatures have caused sea-levels to rise, and an increase in  floods and droughts, all forcing groups of people to leave their homes  There is also a rapid decline in populations of species worldwide that many scientists are referring to as the “Sixth Mass Extinction.” Our Earth is becoming less and less welcoming due to human impact, and our population is continuing to increase!

The dark lines throughout the spectrum are caused by absorption of light by various elements in the Sun's atmosphere. This dark-line absorption spectrum is sort of like a fingerprint of the Sun; it provides scientists with lots of information about the chemical composition of the Sun and even about the temperature of different regions of the solar atmosphere.

# Model 1:


![center](image-9.png)


<!---
The moving blue sound source emits sound waves at a constant frequency.
The emitted sound waves are shown as black circular lines. These circles can be understood to represent the crests of the sound waves.

The stationary black microphone is the receiver of the sound waves. It flashes green when it receives a sound wave's crest. The computer plays a snare drum hit sound to indicate when the microphone hears a sound wave crest.

The wave crests moving to the right are smashed together because the moving source somewhat catches up with a newly released crest before it emits another crest. This makes the leading wave crests closer together than they would be if the source were standing still. Also, this smashing together makes more wave crest go by the microphone per second than would go by per second if the source were standing still. The total effect is that the leading waves have a smaller wavelength (the distance between crests) and a higher frequency than they would have if the source were standing still.

The wave crests moving to the left are stretched out because the moving source moves away in the opposite direction  from a new crest before emitting the next crest. Relative to the situation where the source were standing still, these trailing wave crests are further apart, and they go by the microphone less times per second. So, the trailing waves are increased in wavelength and decreased in frequency.

# Model 3

**Goal of this activity**: The perceived change in frequency of sound waves you heard as the sirens came toward and away from you is called the doppler effect. In this investigation you will use a computer simulation to investigate the change in frequency and wavelength of light. 

The doppler effect influences all waves, like sound or light. In the case of light, instead of perceiving changes in pitch (like sound), we perceive changes in color. If something of a particular color is moving at a very high speed away or towards us, you will see a wave associated with a different color. This is the case with objects in the universe, they move at a really high speed. Let’s work on this simulator to understand this better.

# What Does the Light Spectra of Galaxies Tell Us?

Universe: Static, Contracting, or Expanding?

As you remember, as a result of the Doppler effect, if galaxies were moving away from us, the wavelengths would become (hint: shorter or longer?)__________________. If this was the case, then the absorption lines would move toward the ___________ color (hint: red or blue?). Take a look at the light spectra of galaxies you observed at the beginning of this investigation, then with your group members generate and sort ideas that will help you respond to the question: Is the universe static, contracting, or expanding?

# Big Bang Theory 💥 - Summary <!--fit--->

---

# The Universe is approximately **13.7 billion years old**  <!--fit--->

---

# What is the Big Bang?

- The **Big Bang** is the leading explanation of how the universe began.
- It was **not an explosion**, but a rapid expansion from a hot, dense state.
- The universe continues to expand from this moment.

![center w:500](image-11.png)

---

# The Early Universe

- The early universe was incredibly hot and dense.
- **Subatomic particles** like protons, neutrons, and electrons formed during the first seconds.
- As the universe cooled, particles combined to form simple atoms like hydrogen and helium.

![bg fit right](original.webp)

---

# Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)

- **Cosmic Microwave Background** is the "afterglow" of the Big Bang.
- Discovered in 1965 by Penzias and Wilson.
- It provides strong evidence for the Big Bang, showing that the universe was once in a very hot, dense state.

![bg fit right](image-13.png)

---

# Expansion of the Universe

- The universe continues to expand today.
- Galaxies are moving away from each other, as observed through **redshift**.
- **Edwin Hubble's** observations in the 1920s confirmed that the universe is expanding.


![bg fit right vertical](hubblaw-anim.gif)

## Doppler Effect

- The **Doppler Effect**: A change in the frequency of sound, light, or other waves as the source and observer move toward (or away from) each other.

![bg fit right](doppler.gif)

---

# Redshift and Blueshift <!--fit--->

![center](image-10.png)

---

# What is Redshift?

- **Redshift** occurs when light from an object is shifted to longer wavelengths (toward the red part of the spectrum).
- It happens when the source of light is moving **away** from the observer.
- **Hubble’s Law**: The faster a galaxy is moving away, the more its light is redshifted, providing evidence for the expansion of the universe.

---

# What is Blueshift?

- **Blueshift** occurs when light from an object is shifted to shorter wavelengths (toward the blue part of the spectrum).
- It happens when the source of light is moving **toward** the observer.
  
---

# Redshift and the Expanding Universe

- **Redshift** is critical evidence for the **expansion of the universe**.
- As galaxies move away from us, their light is redshifted.
- This supports the **Big Bang Theory**, showing that the universe is still expanding from an initial point.


---

# Dark Energy and the Future of the Universe

- **Dark Energy** is believed to drive the accelerated expansion of the universe.
- The future of the universe depends on how dark energy behaves:
  1. Continued expansion leading to a cold, empty universe.
  2. Or, a "Big Crunch" if gravity overcomes the expansion.

---

# Summary

* The **Big Bang Theory** explains the origin of the universe and its expansion.
* **CMB** is a key piece of evidence supporting the theory.
* The universe is expanding, and **dark energy** plays a crucial role in its future.
