# The Sun 🌞 <!--fit--->

## Unit 1: Discovering New Worlds  
#### Mr. Porter | Maple Hill Jr./Sr. High School

---

<!-- Lesson Objectives -->
## Today’s Goals

- Connect our curiosity about exoplanets and our own Sun  
- Share and discuss our ideas about how the Sun provides energy  
- Begin investigating sunlight using scientific tools and evidence  
- Practice making claims based on patterns in data

---

<!-- Engage: Driving Question -->
## Engage: Why Focus on the Sun?

- During our Driving Question Board launch, we wondered:
  - *Does the exoplanet have a Sun like ours?*
  - *How does the Sun provide the right amount of energy for life?*
- We need to understand our own Sun before we can compare it to others.

<!-- Engage: Surfacing Ideas 

TEACHER NOTE: Give students a minute to think and jot ideas.  

Encourage all students to participate, including using accessible methods for blind students (e.g., audio, Braille).


-->
## Engage: What Do You Know About the Sun?

**Instructions:**
1. Imagine the Sun. Jot down everything that comes to mind.
2. Share your ideas with a partner.
3. As a class, we’ll use the “Rumors” routine to surface and categorize our ideas.

**Look & Listen For:**  
- “It’s very bright.”  
- “It’s yellow or white.”  
- “It’s very hot.”  
- “It’s made of gas.”  
- “There are explosions in it.”

---

<!-- Engage: Observing the Sun 

TEACHER NOTE: This is the brainstorming handout prompt.  

Remind students to connect their ideas to prior experience or observations.

-->
## Engage: Observing the Sun

- We’ll watch NASA telescope footage of the Sun.
- As you watch, write down any new observations you notice.

**Sample observations:**  
- “It looks like lava.”  
- “There are flames and explosions.”  
- “Some parts are darker than others.”

<!-- Engage: Connecting to Energy 

TEACHER NOTE: Encourage students to connect to phenomena they know (e.g., fire, light bulbs, chemical reactions).

-->
## Engage: How Does the Sun Provide So Much Energy?

**Your Task:**  
- Brainstorm 2–5 ideas for how the Sun provides energy (see your handout).
- For each idea, write what you’ve seen or learned that supports your thinking.

---

<!--

TEACHER NOTE: Encourage students to connect to phenomena they know (e.g., fire, light bulbs, chemical reactions).

-->

## Engage: Surfacing Student Ideas
- Read the investigative phenomenon at the top of your handout
- Discuss with a partner:
    - What other phenomena do you know that are associated with a lot of energy?
    - How is that energy produced?
-  Write your best idea about how the Sun works on a sticky note

---

<!--

TEACHER NOTE: Use this slide to prompt metacognition about scientific investigation.  

Ask: Can we take apart the Sun? What can we measure from Earth?

-->

## Engage: How Do We Figure Out How the Sun Works?
- How do we usually figure out how something works?
    - Take it apart?
    - Learn what it’s made of?
    - See how the parts work together?
    - Can we do this with the Sun?
    -  What can we observe from Earth?

## Explore: Investigating Light from the Sun

We can’t take apart the Sun, but we can observe it from Earth!

**Today’s Investigation:**  
- Learn how a spectroscopy telescope works using a simulator
- Analyze sunlight and compare it to light from gases in the lab

---

<!-- Explore: What Does a Spectrometer Tell Us? -->
## Explore: Using a Spectrometer

**Instructions:**
1. Use the [Three Views Spectrum Demonstrator Simulation](https://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/light/threeviewsspectra.html).
    - Note: Link posted on **Canvas**
2. Observe the spectrum from a light bulb.
3. Observe the spectrum after light passes through a gas cloud.
4. Record your observations and explanations on your handout.

---

<!-- Explore: Observing Sunlight -->
## Explore: What Do We See in Sunlight?

- Astronomers use a spectrometer to collect data from the Sun.
- Examine the spectra from three different Sun observations.

**Look for Patterns:**  
- What do you notice about the spectra?  
- Are there features that repeat?  
- What might cause these patterns?

<!-- Explore: Comparing Sun & Lab Spectra -->
## Explore: Comparing Sun & Lab Spectra

- Compare the Sun’s spectrum to spectra from hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen gases.
- Use the “See-Think-Wonder” chart on your handout:
  - **See:** What patterns do you observe?
  - **Think:** What could these patterns mean?
  - **Wonder:** What questions do you have?

---

<!-- Explore: Making Connections -->
## Explore: What Can We Infer?

- What connections can you make between the Sun’s spectrum and the spectra of different gases?
- What does this tell you about what the Sun is made of?
- Be ready to share your ideas and evidence with the class.

---

<!-- Routine Reminders -->
## Group Learning Routines

- **Rumors:** Share your most confident idea with several classmates, listen for trends, and report out.
- **Domino Discover:** Each group shares one key understanding with the class.
- **See-Think-Wonder:** Use this organizer to connect evidence to claims and questions.

---

<!-- Next Steps -->
## What’s Next?

- We’ll use our evidence and observations to develop a claim about the Sun’s composition.
- Keep thinking about:  
  - What patterns do you see?
  - What evidence supports your ideas?
  - What questions do you still have?

---

<!-- Exit Ticket / Reflection -->
## Exit Ticket

- What is one idea or question about the Sun’s energy that you’re curious to investigate further?
- What is one thing you learned or observed today that surprised you?
