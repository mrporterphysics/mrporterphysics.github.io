<!-- Explore: Observing Sunlight -->
## Explore: What Do We See in Sunlight?

- Astronomers use a spectrometer to collect data from the Sun.
- Examine the spectra from three different Sun observations.

**Look for Patterns:**  
- What do you notice about the spectra?  
- Are there features that repeat?  
- What might cause these patterns?

# What is the **electromagnetic spectrum**?

* Full range of electromagnetic radiation
* Divided into bands
    - separated by characteristics such as how they are produced

<!-- Explore: Comparing Sun & Lab Spectra -->
## Explore: Comparing Sun & Lab Spectra

- Compare the Sun‚Äôs spectrum to spectra from hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen gases.
- Use the ‚ÄúSee-Think-Wonder‚Äù chart on your handout:
  - **See:** What patterns do you observe?
  - **Think:** What could these patterns mean?
  - **Wonder:** What questions do you have?

- What connections can you make between the Sun‚Äôs spectrum and the spectra of different gases?
- What does this tell you about what the Sun is made of?
- Be ready to share your ideas and evidence with the class.

---

<!-- Next Steps -->
## What‚Äôs Next?

- We‚Äôll use our evidence and observations to develop a claim about the Sun‚Äôs composition.

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Use this slide to introduce the purpose of the Explain phase.
-->
## Explain: Making Sense of the Evidence

- Use patterns in data to develop a claim about the Sun‚Äôs composition
- Practice supporting claims with scientific evidence
- Work toward a class consensus about how the Sun works

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Reconnect to the driving question.  
Prompt students to recall what they are trying to figure out.
-->
## What Are We Trying to Figure Out?

- Does the exoplanet have a Sun like ours?
- What is our Sun made of, and how does it release energy?
- What counts as an evidence-based claim in science?

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Facilitate a class discussion about what counts as evidence.  
Encourage students to share their thinking and experiences from Engage/Explore.
-->
## What Counts as an Evidence-Based Claim?

- Information from a reliable source or experiment
- Evidence from an investigation or data
- Not just someone‚Äôs opinion
- Agreement among scientists
- Patterns in data can serve as evidence

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Remind students to refer back to the class poster or board of ideas from Engage.
-->
## Using Evidence to Support or Revise Our Ideas

- Review your observations from the Explore phase
- Does your evidence support your initial ideas?
- Do you need to revise your thinking?

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: This is the sequencing card sort.  
Encourage students to work in pairs or small groups.
-->
## Organize Evidence: How Do We Know What the Sun is Made Of?

**Instructions:**  
1. Work with your group to sequence the evidence cards from the sunlight investigation  
2. Put the cards in an order that shows how we can determine the Sun‚Äôs composition  
3. Be ready to explain your reasoning

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Circulate and listen for key ideas as students work.  
Prompt students to cite specific evidence and patterns.
-->
## Look & Listen For

- White light contains many wavelengths (colors)
- A spectrometer separates light into its component wavelengths
- When white light passes through a gas, some wavelengths are absorbed (black lines)
- Each gas has a unique pattern of absorption lines
- The Sun‚Äôs spectrum matches the patterns for hydrogen and helium

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Students write a scientific explanation (CER) about the Sun‚Äôs composition.  
Offer scaffolds as needed.
-->
## Write a Scientific Explanation

**Prompt:**  
- What is the Sun made of? How do you know?

**Use the CER (Claim-Evidence-Reasoning) approach:**  
- **Claim:** What do you think the Sun is composed of?  
- **Evidence:** What data supports your claim?  
- **Reasoning:** How does your evidence support your claim?

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Sample conferring questions to guide students' explanations.
-->
## Conferring Prompts

- Why does the evidence tell us the Sun is composed of hydrogen and helium?
- What patterns did you use as evidence?
- How do you know there is a pattern?
- What makes your explanation convincing?

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Scaffold for students who need support.  
Encourage use of the CER chart or sentence starters.
-->
## Need Help Getting Started?

- Use the CER chart on your handout
- Try sentence starters:
  - ‚ÄúThe Sun is composed of‚Ä¶‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúThe evidence for this is‚Ä¶‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúThis evidence supports my claim because‚Ä¶‚Äù

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Class consensus routine.  
Select groups to share explanations that move the class forward.
-->
## Class Consensus Discussion

- Groups share their scientific explanations
- Listen for:
  - Use of patterns as evidence
  - Clear reasoning linking evidence to claim
- As a class, discuss and agree on the best-supported claim

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Key points to ensure are surfaced during discussion.
-->
## Take Time for These Key Points

- The Sun is made mostly of hydrogen and helium
- We know this from spectra data and patterns
- Patterns in evidence are a useful lens for figuring out other things in space science

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Encourage students to reflect on their learning and the process.
-->
## Reflection & Summary

- What did you learn about making evidence-based claims?
- How did using patterns in data help you figure out what the Sun is made of?
- What questions do you still have about the Sun?

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Use as an exit ticket or homework prompt.
-->
## Exit Ticket

- What is one thing you learned about how scientists use evidence to make claims?
- What is one question you still have about the Sun or its energy?

# How the Sun Works:  
Elaborate & Evaluate  
Earth & Space Science ‚Äì Unit 1

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Introduce the purpose of the Elaborate phase.
-->
## Elaborate: Explaining How the Sun Releases Energy

- Use evidence and reasoning to explain the process that releases the Sun‚Äôs energy
- Compare chemical and nuclear reactions as possible sources
- Connect the scale and duration of energy release to scientific explanations

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Remind students of their earlier ideas about explosions, burning, and chemical reactions.
-->
## Revisiting Our Ideas

- We know the Sun is made of hydrogen and helium
- But how do these elements release so much energy for so long?
- Let‚Äôs analyze the evidence for two possible processes:
  - Chemical reactions
  - Nuclear reactions

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Students analyze the data table comparing chemical and nuclear processes.
-->
## Analyze the Evidence

**Possible Energy-Releasing Processes in the Sun:**
- **Chemical:**  
  - Small amount of energy per reaction  
  - Would only power the Sun for ~50,000 years
- **Nuclear (Fusion):**  
  - Much more energy per reaction  
  - Can power the Sun for ~10 billion years

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Students use claim and data cards to sort evidence and reasoning.
-->
## Card Sort: Which Process Powers the Sun?

**Instructions:**  
1. Work with your partner to sort the claim and data cards  
2. Decide which evidence supports chemical or nuclear reactions  
3. Add your reasoning to the cards as needed

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Circulate and use conferring prompts to push student thinking.
-->
## Conferring Prompts

- What made you decide this card supports your claim?
- Is there evidence that can support both claims?
- Which claim has stronger evidence?
- How does the scale of energy and time help you decide?

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Students write a scientific explanation for how the Sun releases energy.
-->
## Write Your Scientific Explanation

**Prompt:**  
- Is the Sun‚Äôs energy released by chemical or nuclear reactions?  
- Use evidence and reasoning to support your claim

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Encourage students to reflect on what makes evidence strong.
-->
## What Counts as an Evidence-Based Claim?

- Information from a reliable source
- Evidence from an experiment or investigation
- Not just an opinion
- Patterns in data can count as evidence
- Claims can be revised based on new evidence

---

<!--
TEACHER NOTE: Transition to Evaluate phase.  
Students will revise and critique their models and make predictions.
-->
## Evaluate: Revising and Predicting

- Revise your model of how the Sun works based on new evidence
- Use your model to predict what will happen to
