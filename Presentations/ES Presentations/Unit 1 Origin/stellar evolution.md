What did the first galaxies look like? To help answer this question, the Hubble Space Telescope has just finished taking the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), the deepest image of the universe ever taken in visible light. Pictured above, the HUDF shows a sampling of the oldest galaxies ever seen, galaxies that formed just after the dark ages, 13 billion years ago, when the universe was only 5 percent of its present age. The Hubble Space Telescope's NICMOS and new ACS cameras took the image. Staring nearly 3 months at the same spot, the HUDF is four times more sensitive, in some colors, than the original Hubble Deep Field (HDF). Astronomers the world over will likely study the HUDF for years to come to better understand how stars and galaxies formed in the early universe.

WHAT DO YOU OBSERVE?

WHAT DO YOU OBSERVE IN THE SPECRTRA

The stars are different colors
The stars are different sizes 
The stars vary in brightness
The stars are different shapes and we see much more detail 
The sample spectra of stars indicates they are made of hydrogen and helium just like our Sun
The difference in color is caused by temperature
The difference in size has to do with distance
The difference in brightness has to do with distance

# A Definition:

### **Luminosity** - energy radiated by a star per second, the power output of a star

### Herzsprung-Russell Diagram

![bg fit right](image-16.png)

- On Earth Science Reference Table
- Tells us about stars' temperature, luminosity and classification
- Luminosity value is in refernce to ***our sun***

### Simulation

- We are going to go through each question and document our answers
- Play with the simulation on your own, then share your answer with your table partner
- I will take a volunteer to share to the class
