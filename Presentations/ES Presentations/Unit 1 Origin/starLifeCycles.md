# Engage
What happens to stars over time? What will happen to our Sun?

- Observe a data visualization of Supernova 1054 (Crab Nebula remnant).
- Individually answer Q1–Q4 on “What Was Supernova 1054?”
- Share in Domino Discover routine.

Prompt:
- What might cause a star to change and explode?
- What other phenomena are similar to a supernova?

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Project the visualization/video; narrate.
- If students don’t mention gravity, nuclear fusion, or nebula formation, seed those ideas.
- For Keira: provide verbal description of the visualization and printed Braille/tactile summaries.

## Engage: Access & Setup

- Materials: “What Was Supernova 1054?” handout; video link; images
- Pair-share: Generate questions about star stability relevant to Earth-like planets
- Post class questions under “What do we need to know about other stars?”

Implementation tip:
- Patterns & Stability: Ask “Are changes in stars fast or slow? Do patterns differ across stars?”

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Facilitate Domino Discover. Capture top 3 class-relevant questions to carry forward.
-->


---

# Explore 1
Observing patterns of star stability and change

Goal:
- Use a computational model (Star in a Box) to collect data on star mass, lifespan, and stability.

Focus data:
- Time (lifespan), size (radius), temperature, luminosity

Task:
- Complete “What Kinds of Stars Have Long and Stable Life Spans?” in pairs.
- Group stars by life-cycle category; fill Group 1 as example.

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Model link: https://starinabox.lco.global/
- Clarify computational models are evidence-based.
- Conferring questions: Which stages change least/most? Relation of mass to lifespan and stability?
-->

---

## Explore 1: See–Think–Wonder

Synthesize:
- See: Patterns observed in mass vs. lifespan/stability
- Think: Implications for supporting Earth-like planets
- Wonder: New questions about star change

If counterintuitive:
- Discuss why higher‑mass stars die faster.

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- If key observations didn’t surface, run a demo and prompt with questions.
- Differentiate: sentence starters in “See” column; sample responses for tables.
-->

---

# Explore 2
Making connections between observable star properties and lifespan

Goal:
- Develop a mathematical model (HR Diagram) with provided star circles.
- Identify patterns relating temperature, luminosity, color, mass, and expected lifespan.

Task:
- Plot the 60-star set on poster-size HR template.
- Complete See–Think–Wonder; share via Domino Discover.

Look for:
- Hotter → brighter; main sequence clustering
- Red stars = longest expected lifespan
- ~1 solar mass stars stable >10 billion years

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Emphasize Patterns CCC; color–temp–luminosity relationships.
- Address outliers (not on main trend line) later during Explain/Extension.
-->

---

## Explore 2: Class List

Build a consensus list:
- Properties that allow predictions of lifespan & stability
- Kinds of stars that live long, stable lives

Important:
- Mass predicts life cycle & stability
- Color/temperature/luminosity indicate mass → stability
- Post‑main‑sequence changes are large and disruptive

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Capture the list on chart paper for reference in Explain and Evaluate.
-->

---

# Explain
Developing an explanatory model for stability and change

Core ideas:
- Gravity pulls matter inward; fusion releases energy outward.
- Stability occurs when inward gravity and outward fusion pressures are balanced.
- More massive stars fuse faster → higher luminosity → shorter lifespans.

Task:
- Read “How and Why do Stars Change” with text annotation:
  - Circle: info for size increases
  - Underline: info for size decreases
  - Box: uncertainties; annotate questions
- Label force diagrams for key stages.

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Facilitate causal reasoning: how/why stars change.
- Use Natural Reader for ELL/below-level readers.
- Video: Star Formation by Collapse of Molecular Clouds—students note gravity-driven collapse.
-->

---

## Explain: Evidence & Reasoning

From model/data:
- Main sequence = most stable; ~90% of life
- Lifespans (example): 1 M☉ ~8993 Myr; 4 M☉ ~179 Myr; 40 M☉ ~4.9 Myr
- Hydrogen→helium conversion time: faster for higher mass (e.g., 10 M☉ ~19.5 Myr vs 1 M☉ ~10 Gyr)
- Higher mass → higher luminosity (energy per second)

Summary task prompts:
1. How did you use models & evidence to explain star life cycles?
2. Why does stability matter for habitability?
3. What new questions remain?

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Elevate key points on a shared HR diagram.
- If needed, assign “Why do some stars not fall on the main trend line?” as extension.
-->

---

# Class Consensus Discussion

Steps:
1. Selected groups present claims & models
2. Peers paraphrase & ask clarifying questions
3. Whole-class discussion; agree on shared representation

Prompts:
- Why do higher mass stars die faster?
- How does luminosity relate to fusion rate?
- How long must a star be stable to support life?

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Choose claims that advance understanding.
- Link back to Patterns across scales (solar system, cluster, atomic).
-->

---

# Elaborate
Explaining differences in stability via nucleosynthesis

Model:
- Iron [26] game to simulate gravity-driven fusion rates
- Represent gravity:
  - High-mass star → faster random key taps
  - Low-mass star → slower random key taps

Tasks:
- “Why do more massive stars change and die faster?”
- “How are elements heavier than iron produced?”

Look for:
- Stronger gravity → more frequent, energetic collisions → faster fusion → higher luminosity
- High-mass stars produce heavier elements; supernova required for >Fe

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Use Think–Talk–Open Exchange to articulate ideas.
- Video: Stephen Hawking – Supernovas to close phenomenon loop.
- Assess CCC Patterns across scales (supercluster, Sun, atomic).
-->

---

## Elaborate: Reflection

Prompt:
- Why was it necessary to study stars at multiple scales (supercluster, one star, atomic) to explain stability and change?

Write:
- Short paragraph referencing modeled patterns at each scale.

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Collect for formative assessment; highlight the multi-scale reasoning.
-->

---

# Evaluate
Constructing arguments: Which star best supports an Earth-like planet?

Tasks:
- Revise group models (Idea Carousel routine)
- Annotate peer models: ✔ resonates; ➕ add; ? question; Δ clarify
- Use Star Life Cycles Model & Argument rubrics
- Return to Performance Task Organizer; self-assess & revise

Consider:
- Main sequence stars ≤ 1 M☉ with stable properties ≥ 9–10 Gyr
- Exclude: blue giants (Eta Carinae), red giants (Kepler-432), faint white dwarfs (Gliese 440)

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Provide rubric, sample composite work, peer review flow.
- Emphasize evidence-based claims using patterns, stability, and nucleosynthesis reasoning.
-->

---

## Evaluate: Driving Question Board

Revisit:
- What did we figure out?
- What do we still need to investigate?
- Generate one new question on planet characteristics (distance, temperature, liquid water, atmosphere, terrestrial vs jovian)

Next 5E:
- Focus on planets’ habitable zones and liquid water evidence.

<!--
TEACHER NOTE:
- Transition to next investigation; capture questions for planning.
