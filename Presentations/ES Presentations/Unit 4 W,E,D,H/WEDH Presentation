# Sediments

* Sediments are **broken up bits of rock**.
* Examples include: **silt, sand, mud, gravel, boulders**
* Sediment results from the **weathering** of rock.

# Weathering is the breaking down of rock into smaller pieces.

## There are 2 kinds of weathering:

1) **Mechanical weathering** - when rock is broken up by physical processes.
2) **Chemical Weathering** - when rock is broken up by chemical processes.

# Factors Affecting Weathering Rates

1. **Climate**: 
   - Wetter climates mean faster weathering
   - Warmer climates favor chemical weathering
   - Cooler climates favor physical weathering

2. **Mineral/Rock Composition**:
   - Harder rock resists weathering

# Weathering Types

|Mechanical Weathering|Chemical Weathering|
|:--|:--|
|1. Freezing and Thawing (Frost Action)|1. Oxygen|
|Water seeps into cracks, **freezes**, expands, and forces the rock apart|**Iron** combines with oxygen in a process called **oxidation** producing rust|

# Weathering Types (continued)

|Mechanical Weathering|Chemical Weathering|
|:--|:--|
|2. Animal Action|2. Carbon Dioxide|
|Animals such as moles **loosen** & **break apart** rocks in the soil|Carbon dioxide mixes with water to form **carbonic acid**|

# Weathering Types (continued)

|Mechanical Weathering|Chemical Weathering|
|:--|:--|
|3. Plant Growth|3. Acid Rain|
|**Roots** can grow into cracks in rock and **force** it apart|Burning **coal** and **gas** produces compounds that react with water vapor to create acid rain|

# Weathering Types (continued)

|Mechanical Weathering|Chemical Weathering|
|:--|:--|
|4. Abrasion|4. Living Organisms|
|The physical weathering of rocks as they **rub** or **bounce** against each other|Plant roots create **weak acids** that help to soften up rocks|

# Weathering Types (continued)

|Mechanical Weathering|Chemical Weathering|
|:--|:--|
|5. Release of Pressure|5. Water|
|As pressure on a rock is **reduced**, the release of **pressure** causes the outside of the rock to crack|Water weathers rock by **dissolving** it, by **wave** action, and by carrying it away in rivers|

# Weathering Rates 

Factors that affect weathering

- Climate - wetter climates mean faster weathering
- Warm climates favor chemical weatherin
- Cooler climates favor physical weathering
- Mineral/ Rock composition - harder rock resists weathering

# Erosion 

## is the transport of sediments from one place to another

# Agents of Erosion


1) **Wind**
   * Fragments of rock are more **angular** and pitted or frosted
   * Examples include **sand** dunes

# Agents of Erosion


2) **Water** (Greatest Agent of Erosion)
   * Rock fragments are very **smooth** and rounded
   * Examples include **rivers**

# Agents of Erosion

3) **Ice** - Glaciers
    * Glaciers are able to carry the largest to smallest sediments

# Agents of Erosion 

4) Gravity
    * the agent of erosion behind the water, ice and wind.
