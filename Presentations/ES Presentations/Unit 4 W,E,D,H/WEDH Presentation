# Topic 4: Sedimentary Processes

# Sediments

* Sediments are **broken up bits of rock**.
* Examples include: **silt, sand, mud, gravel, boulders**
* Sediment results from the **weathering** of rock.

# Weathering is the breaking down of rock into smaller pieces.

## There are 2 kinds of weathering:

1) **Mechanical weathering** - when rock is broken up by physical processes.
2) **Chemical Weathering** - when rock is broken up by chemical processes.

---

# Factors Affecting Weathering Rates

1. **Climate**: 
   - Wetter climates mean faster weathering
   - Warmer climates favor chemical weathering
   - Cooler climates favor physical weathering

2. **Mineral/Rock Composition**:
   - Harder rock resists weathering

# Weathering Types

|Mechanical Weathering|Chemical Weathering|
|:--|:--|
|1. Freezing and Thawing (Frost Action)|1. Oxygen|
|Water seeps into cracks, **freezes**, expands, and forces the rock apart|**Iron** combines with oxygen in a process called **oxidation** producing rust|

|2. Animal Action|2. Carbon Dioxide|
|Animals such as moles **loosen** & **break apart** rocks in the soil|Carbon dioxide mixes with water to form **carbonic acid**|

|3. Plant Growth|3. Acid Rain|
|**Roots** can grow into cracks in rock and **force** it apart|Burning **coal** and **gas** produces compounds that react with water vapor to create acid rain|

|4. Abrasion|4. Living Organisms|
|The physical weathering of rocks as they **rub** or **bounce** against each other|Plant roots create **weak acids** that help to soften up rocks|

# Weathering Types (continued)

|Mechanical Weathering|Chemical Weathering|
|:--|:--|
|5. Release of Pressure|5. Water|
|As pressure on a rock is **reduced**, the release of **pressure** causes the outside of the rock to crack|Water weathers rock by **dissolving** it, by **wave** action, and by carrying it away in rivers|

# Erosion 

## is the transport of sediments from one place to another

# Agents of Erosion


1) **Wind**
   * Fragments of rock are more **angular** and pitted or frosted
   * Examples include **sand** dunes

   ![bg fit right](image-13.png)

---

# Agents of Erosion


2) **Water** (Greatest Agent of Erosion)
   * Rock fragments are very **smooth** and rounded
   * Examples include **rivers**

# Agents of Erosion

3) **Ice** - Glaciers
    * Glaciers are able to carry the largest to smallest sediments

# Agents of Erosion 

4) Gravity
    * the agent of erosion behind the water, ice and wind.

# Glacier Landscape Features


Glacier - a large, long lasting mass of ice which forms on land and moves down slope due to gravity.

# How Do Glaciers Form?
## Step 1: Snow accumulates.

More snow falls during the winter than melts in the summer.

Over the years, a thick accumulation of snow develops.

![bg fit right](image-19.png)

---

# Step 2: Snow changes to firn.

As snow accumulates, its weight compress the individual snowflakes to form firn.

![bg fit left](image-20.png)

---

# Step 3: Firn is compressed to form solid glacial ice.

![bg fit right ](image-21.png)

---

# Step 4: The ice begins to move.

Once the ice becomes 50m thick, the pressure on the bottom of the glacier is so great that it becomes plastic-like and flows like silly putty out from its thickest point.

---

## How do glaciers erode the surface?
- Plucking â€“ as a glacier flows over the ground, it loosens and lifts blocks of rock into the bottom of the glacier.
- As the glacier moves, these rocks scrape deep grooves, called striations, into the rock below.

---

# Glacial Erosion
- As a glacier slides over rock, it **abrades** (or scratches) the bedrock. ***Striations*** and grooves show where rocks abraded the bedrock.

# Two Types of Glaciers

## Alpine Glacier

confined to a valley and flow down hill. (present U.S. glaciers )

![bg fit right](image-26.png)

---

## Continental Glaciers 

(Ice Sheets) - thick mass of ice that covers over 50,000 square km. (Antarctica and Greenland)

![bg fit left](image-27.png)

# Melting Glaciers 

As glaciers move over the land (advance), they carry sediment with them. As they melt (retreat), the sediment that they were carrying is dropped into unsorted piles called moraines.

![bg fit right](image-28.png)

---

- **Ground moraine** - a thin layer of till dropped by a glacier as it melted.
- **Medial moraine** - forms between the lateral moraines of two glaciers that
meet and form into one.

# Why do scientists believe that glaciers once covered Michigan?

---

# [Laurentide Ice Sheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbsURVgoRD0)

- Covered Eastern North America during the Ice Ages.
- NYS is covered with glacial landforms.

---

Moraines Deposits are made of unsorted sediments. Only mass movements and glaciers deposit unsorted sediments.

![center w:150](image-33.png)

Since there are no large hills or mountains in Michigan for this sediment to fall down, it must have been deposited by the glaciers.

![bg fit right](image-34.png)

---

Moraine Deposits have the same shape as the Great Lakes.
- Michigan moraines run parallel to the shoreline.
- The same process that formed the moraines formed the Great Lakes.

# Kettle Lakes
- Kettle lakes form when blocks of ice break off the front edge of a glacier, become buried by sediment. The ice melts leaving a hole which fills with water creating a lake.

![center w:550](image-36.png)

---

## **Kettle** - forms when an ice block breaks off, then melts, and leaves behind a steep sided hole. This often forms a lake or pond.

# Porosity & Permeability Lab
ðŸ¥…: Understanding How Water Moves Through Earth Materials

---

## Key Concepts

**Porosity**
- Ratio of pore space to solid space
- Measured as a percentage
- Affects water storage capacity

**Permeability**
- Rate of water flow through material
- Measured in mL/second
- Determines how easily water moves

---

## Lab Setup

![height:400px](https://api.placeholder.com/400/300)

**Equipment per Station:**
- Plastic tubing with screen
- Ring stand and clamp
- Drainage fixture
- Collection beakers
- Graduated cylinder

---

## Part A: Investigating Bead Size Effects

We'll test three bead sizes:
- 12mm (large)
- 7mm (medium)
- 4mm (small)

**Make your hypothesis:**
Which size will have the highest permeability?

---

## Measuring Porosity

1. Add 100mL water
2. Record volume needed to cover beads
3. Calculate percentage:

$$
\text{Porosity} = \frac{\text{Pore Space (mL)}}{100 \text{ cm}^3} \times 100
$$

---

## Testing Permeability

1. Time how long 300mL takes to drain
2. Calculate rate:

$$
\text{Permeability} = \frac{\text{Volume (mL)}}{\text{Time (seconds)}}
$$
