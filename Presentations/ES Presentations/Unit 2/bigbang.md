<!-- ========== LESSON 1 — ENGAGE ========== -->

# Lesson 1 — Engage
## Where did everything come from?

### _Has the universe always been the same?_
- Task:
  - Write an initial claim: How did the universe form and lead to stars and planets?
  - Choose your best idea and put it on your mini whiteboard.

---

## Rumors Routine
- Move around and share your claim
- Listen for similarities/differences
- Norms:
  - Honor all ideas; we will examine scientific evidence next
  - Focus on testable, scientific claims in upcoming lessons

---

## Video: How Many Stars?

- What surprised you?
- What does “many stars → many planets” suggest?

---

## Why study origin?
- Scientists compare galaxies/solar systems by understanding how the universe formed
- We’ll use evidence to build a scientific model (compatible with many beliefs, focused on testable claims)

---

<!-- ========== LESSON 2 — EXPLORE ========== -->

# Lesson 2 — Explore
## Investigating light from other galaxies
- Phenomenon:
  - Galaxy absorption lines match H/He patterns but are shifted to red
- Question:
  - Why are lines more redshifted for more distant galaxies?

---

## Models We’ll Use
- Model 1: Doppler (sound, moving source)
- Model 2: Piano (pitch ↔ frequency/wavelength)
- Model 3: Galaxy redshift (light + motion)
- Model 4: EM spectrum (frequency ↔ color)

---

## See–Think–Wonder (Group)
- See:
  - Toward observer → waves bunch → higher frequency
  - Away from observer → waves spread → lower frequency
- Think:
  - Sound behavior helps explain light behavior
- Wonder:
  - How does motion change perceived color?

---

## Key Observations
- Sound: Higher pitch = higher frequency = shorter wavelength
- Light:
  - Moving away → lower frequency, longer wavelength → redder
  - Moving toward → higher frequency, shorter wavelength → bluer
- Distant galaxies show increasing redshift with distance

---

<!-- ========== LESSON 3 — EXPLAIN ========== -->

# Lesson 3 — Explain
## Explaining redshift
- Claim to test:
  - If spectra redshift increases with distance, the universe is expanding

---

## Construct Your Explanation
- Use wave-model evidence:
  - H/He absorption signatures shift red
  - Redshift magnitude increases with distance
- Link:
  - Expansion → galaxies recede → light stretches → redshift

---

## Class Consensus Discussion
- Steps:
  1) Selected groups present claims + reasoning
  2) Peers restate + ask clarifying questions
  3) Table confers → whole-class agreement
- Focus prompts:
  - How did models serve as evidence?
  - Was energy destroyed or transformed?
  - What are model limitations?

---

## Take Time for These Key Points
- H/He absorption patterns shift red with distance
- Longer wavelengths (red) indicate motion away
- Therefore, the universe is expanding

---

## Summary Task (Exit Ticket)
- Write a short paragraph:
  - Your explanation for redshift
  - Evidence (models + spectra)
  - One limitation or lingering question

---

<!-- ========== LESSON 4 — ELABORATE ========== -->

# Lesson 4 — Elaborate
## If the universe is expanding, what was it like before?
- Guiding Question:
  - If expanding now, what was it like 13+ billion years ago?

---

## Balloon Model Activity
* Inflate = expansion
* Inferences:
  - Earlier universe: smaller, denser, hotter
  - Galaxies closer in the past; at the beginning → clumped

---


## Conservation Principles

* Energy isn’t created/destroyed; it moves/changes
* Matter isn’t created/destroyed; it moves/changes
* Implication:
  - Early H, He, and energy should persist today (possibly transformed)

---

## Test the Big Bang Claim
- Predict present-day evidence:
  - Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): cooled, stretched radiation
  - H/He ratios: ~3/4 H and ~1/4 He (primordial nucleosynthesis)
  - Light stretching: visible light shifts to longer wavelengths over time
- Compare predictions to observations

---

## Read + Analyze
- Read short text on early universe temperature/pressure
- Watch: Origins of the Universe (0:00–1:10)
- Pair work:
  - Make 3–4 testable predictions
  - Match with observed data (CMB maps, elemental abundances)

---

## Consensus (Evidence)
* Prompts:
  - How did conservation help link evidence to claims?
  - Which evidence most strongly supports Big Bang?
* Key points:
  - H:He ratio aligns with early-universe formation
  - Stretched waves explain microwave background
  - Evidence supports a small, hot, dense early universe

<!-- ========== LESSON 5 — EVALUATE ========== -->

# Lesson 5 — Evaluate
## Is life elsewhere probable?
- Use your origin/formation model:
  - Big universe → many stars → many planets
  - Similar formation processes → similar features across galaxies

---

## Model Earth-like Planets
- Pair activity:
  - Build a formation/solar system model
  - Consider habitability (star type, orbit, atmosphere, time)
- Questions:
  - How many opportunities for life?
  - What increases/decreases probability?

---

## Idea Carousel (Peer Critique)
- Annotate peers’ models with:
  - ✔ Resonates
  - + Add
  - ? Question relevance
  - Δ Clarify/represent more clearly
- Revise your model using feedback

---

## Revisiting the Performance Task
- Individually:
  - Claim: Probability of life elsewhere
  - Evidence:
    - Expansion + scale (stars/planets)
    - Formation processes across galaxies
    - CMB + H/He ratios supporting origin model
  - Address counterpoints/uncertainties

---

## Driving Question Board (Closure)
- Which questions did we answer?
- What’s next?
  - Stability of the solar system
  - Extinction and contact: Could intelligent life be rare or short-lived?

---

# Check Your Understanding
- Why does redshift increase with distance?
- What does the CMB tell us?
- Why is the H/He ratio important?
- How do conservation laws connect past to present?
- What evidence supports the claim that life elsewhere is probable?

---

# End of Unit — Key Takeaways
- Universe is expanding (redshift evidence)
- Early universe was small, hot, dense (CMB + abundances)
- Big Bang explains present-day observations
- Similar formation pathways suggest many Earth-like planets may exist
