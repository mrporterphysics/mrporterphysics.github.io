# Geologic Dating — Absolute
### Regents Earth Science

- Absolute dating determines the numerical age of rocks and fossils.
- Common methods: radiometric dating (e.g., radiocarbon, uranium–lead, potassium–argon).
- Used to build a timeline of Earth’s history.

---

## Relative vs. Absolute Dating

- Relative dating orders events without exact ages (e.g., superposition, cross-cutting).
- Absolute dating assigns a measurable age (years).
- Both methods are complementary in geologic investigations.

---

## Radioactive Decay Basics

- Unstable parent isotopes decay into stable daughter isotopes.
- Decay follows an exponential law characterized by half-life.
- Half-life: time for half of the parent atoms to decay.

---

## Radiocarbon (Carbon-14) Dating

- Carbon-14 is produced in the atmosphere and incorporated into living organisms.
- After death, C-14 decays; no new C-14 is added.
- Effective dating range: up to ~50,000 years.
- Measured via ratio of C-14 to stable C-12/C-13.


---

## Assumptions and Calibration

- Closed system: no gain/loss of C after death.
- Known initial C-14/C-12 ratio (requires standards).
- Calibration with tree-ring data and other archives accounts for past atmospheric variation.

---

## Other Radiometric Methods

- Uranium–Lead: zircon crystals; ages from millions to billions of years.
- Potassium–Argon / Argon–Argon: volcanic rocks; >100,000 years.
- Rubidium–Strontium, Samarium–Neodymium: metamorphic/igneous contexts.

---

## Applications

- Archeology: dating artifacts and human remains.
- Paleontology: constraining fossil ages via volcanic layers.
- Quaternary geology: glacial/interglacial timelines.
- Climate records: lake sediments, peat, cave deposits.

---

## Limits and Sources of Error

- Contamination (modern carbon, conservation materials).
- Reservoir effects (marine vs terrestrial carbon).
- Measurement precision, sample preservation.
- Beyond method range → large uncertainty.

## Case Study: Interpreting a Radiocarbon Result

- Report example: 12,300 ± 120 BP (before present, 1950).
- Calibrated age range provided (e.g., 14,200–13,900 cal BP).
- Contextualize with stratigraphy and other evidence.
