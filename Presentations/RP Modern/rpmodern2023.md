# Photoelectric Problem

* EM radiation striking a metal may emit electrons (photoelectrons).
* Not all EM radiation creates electrons.
* Higher intensity (brighter) light doesn’t affect whether photoelectrons are created.
* Higher frequencies of light affect creation of photoelectrons. 

---

### Photoelectric Effect with Einstein

* Electrons in the metal are held by an “energy well.”
* Electrons must absorb at least enough energy to get out of the well in order to become free of the metal.
* Electrons had to absorb a single photon with that minimum amount of energy, known as the work function. 
* Any excess energy absorbed becomes the free electron’s kinetic energy. 

---

# Work Function 

![center w:600](figures/workfunction.webp)

---

# So do particles have wave behavior?

---

# Compton Effect

* Arthur Compton shot x-rays so that they collided with electrons in graphite. 
    * Photoelectron is emitted
    * Original x-ray was reemitted with a lower wavelength
    * So the photon lost energy and momentum
* Conclusion: photons has momentum and obey the laws of conservation of momentum and energy. 

---

# Compton Effect 

![center w:500](figures/photonp.webp)

---

# Compton Effect Equations 

- Combine $E = mc^2$, $E = hf$, and $c=f\lambda$ the momentum of a photon can be expressed as:

$$ p = \frac{E}{C}=\frac{hf}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}$$

---

# de Broglie Wavelength 

* EM waves behave as particles
* Moving particles can exhibit wave properties
* Confirmed by shooting electrons through a double slit and seeing a diffraction pattern. 
* Smaller particles have more wavelike behavior
* $\lambda = h/p = h/mv$

---

1. Particles only
1. waves only
1. both particles and waves
1. neither particles or waves

---

### Rutherford’s Gold Foil Experiment


* Shot alpha particles (helium nuclei) at a thin sheet of gold foil
    * Most particles went through undeflected
    * Some particles were deflected by large amounts
* Conclusions:
    * Atoms have a small, massive, positive nucleus
    * Electrons must orbit the nucleus
    * Most of the atom is empty space

# Bohr

* Each atom allows only a limited number of specific orbits (electrons) per energy level
* Electrons can change energy levels

    * Emit a photon of exactly the energy difference as electron falls to a lower level.
    * $E_{photon} = E_i - E_f$

# Hydrogen Atom

![bg left:35% fit](figures/hydrogen.png)

- Negative energy levels indicate electron is bound to the atom.
- If the electron reaches 0 eV, it is no longer bound and can be emitted as a photoelectron.
    - Any excess energy becomes the electrons kinetic energy.

# Gas Discharge Lamp 💡

* Gas discharge lamps excited electrons by application of high electrical potential.
    * Electrons jump to higher energy.
    * As they relax to lower energy levels, photons of specific frequencies are emitted.
    * Spectrum is not continuous and is unique to the element.
* Analysis of spectra allows determination of gas composition.
