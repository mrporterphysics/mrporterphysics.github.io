# Photons 

- Smallest possible piece of E&M Light 
    * No rest mass
    * No charge 
    * Move with a velocity of $3 \times 10^8$ m/s

# Energy of a Photon

* Energy of a photon is quantized.
    * Can only come in certain amounts.
* Discovered by Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck to explain blackbody radiation.
* Discovered that $E_{photon} = hf = hc/\lambda$
* Planck’s constant, h, h = 6.63 x 10$^{-34}$ Js
* Energy of a photon can come in amounts proportional to Planck’s constant.

# 🤔 Check Yourself

A photon with a wavelength of $6 \times 10^{-7}$ meters has how much energy?

---

The spectrum of visible light emitted during transitions in excited hydrogen atoms is composed of blue, green, red, and violet lines. What characteristic of light determines the amount of energy carried by the photon. 

1. amplitude 
2. frequency
3. phase
4. velocity

# Photoelectric Problem

* EM radiation striking a metal may emit electrons (photoelectrons).
* Not all EM radiation creates electrons.
* Higher intensity (brighter) light doesn’t affect whether photoelectrons are created.
* Higher frequencies of light affect creation of photoelectrons. 

---

### Photoelectric Effect with Einstein

* Electrons in the metal are held by an “energy well.”
* Electrons must absorb at least enough energy to get out of the well in order to become free of the metal.
* Electrons had to absorb a single photon with that minimum amount of energy, known as the work function. 
* Any excess energy absorbed becomes the free electron’s kinetic energy.

# Work Function 

![center w:600](figures/workfunction.webp)

---

# So do particles have wave behavior?

---

# Compton Effect

* Arthur Compton shot x-rays so that they collided with electrons in graphite. 
    * Photoelectron is emitted
    * Original x-ray was reemitted with a lower wavelength
    * So the photon lost energy and momentum
* Conclusion: photons has momentum and obey the laws of conservation of momentum and energy. 

---

# Compton Effect 

![center w:500](figures/photonp.webp)

---

# Compton Effect Equations 

- Combine $E = mc^2$, $E = hf$, and $c=f\lambda$ the momentum of a photon can be expressed as:

$$ p = \frac{E}{C}=\frac{hf}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}$$

---

# de Broglie Wavelength 

* EM waves behave as particles
* Moving particles can exhibit wave properties
* Confirmed by shooting electrons through a double slit and seeing a diffraction pattern. 
* Smaller particles have more wavelike behavior
* $\lambda = h/p = h/mv$

---

**Moving electrons are found to exhibit properties of**

1. Particles only
1. waves only
1. both particles and waves
1. neither particles or waves

---

**Which phenomenon best supports the theory that matter has a wave nature?**

1. electron momentum
1. electron diffraction
1. photon momentum
1. photon diffraction

**Wave particle duality is most apparent in analyzing the motion of a**

1. baseball
1. space shuttle
1. galaxy
1. electron

**Calculate the wavelength for a tennis ball (57 grams) moving at a speed of 30 m/s.**


Note: $\lambda = h/p = h/mv$

### Rutherford’s Gold Foil Experiment


* Shot alpha particles (helium nuclei) at a thin sheet of gold foil
    * Most particles went through undeflected
    * Some particles were deflected by large amounts
* Conclusions:
    * Atoms have a small, massive, positive nucleus
    * Electrons must orbit the nucleus
    * Most of the atom is empty space

# Rutherfords *Foils*

- The lack of emission radiation as electrons move about the nucleus
- The unique spectrum of each element
- The stability of the atom

# Bohr 

* Electrons can only exist at discrete energy levels
* Each atom allows only a limited number of specific orbits (electrons) per energy level
* Electrons can change energy levels
    * Absorbs a photon of exactly the energy needed to reach a higher level.
    * Emit a photon of exactly the energy difference as electron falls to a lower level.
    * $E_{photon} = E_i - E_f$

# Energy Level Diagram 

- Allows us to visualize energy levels in an atom 
- Lowest energy level is the ground state

---

# Hydrogen Atom

![bg left:35% fit](figures/hydrogen.png)

- Negative energy levels indicate electron is bound to the atom.
- If the electron reaches 0 eV, it is no longer bound and can be emitted as a photoelectron.
    - Any excess energy becomes the electrons kinetic energy.
