# Cart Launcher 🚀

🥅: Determine the compression distance of each hoop spring to launch the carts at the ***same*** speed. 

🔍 Model the situation:

- Draw diagrams to model your cart-spring system
- Use equations to solve for the launch speed of your cart
- Determine what we need to measure to make the prediction

# 🔺 Area

$$Area = \frac{1}{2}Fx$$ 

and...

$$F_S = kx$$

# What is it?

## **Area** of a **Force vs. displacement** graph is **WORK**

Work is the change in energy of a system...

# Work 

* Area of Force vs. displacement graph
* $W = \Delta E_T$ 
* For **constant** or average forces: $W = Fd$$
* Note: only force **parallel** to displacement does work: $F \cos \theta d = W$
