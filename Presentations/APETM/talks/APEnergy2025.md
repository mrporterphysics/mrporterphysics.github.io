# Hot Wheels Car:

On your whiteboards:

* Draw pie charts for where the energy is stored (in what object) at three snapshots:
  * when the launcher is pulled back all the way, but is not released yet
  * when the car is moving, but still touching the launcher
  * when the car is moving and no longer touching the launcher.
* If the energy is stored in more than one object, just divide the pie into slices

---

# Pull-back car

* Draw pie charts for where the energy is stored (in what object) at three snapshots:
  * when the car has been pulled back and is not yet moving
  * then two more when the car is moving and has not yet been stopped

## Work:

_Work is a transfer of energy by a mechanical process (a force exerted on an object or system as it moves through a displacement in the direction of the force)._ The amount of energy transferred in this process is referred to as the work done.

# Energy and Systems

*  A single object or a collection of objects can be referred to as a **system**
* Anything outside of the system is part of the **surroundings (environment)**, and interactions between the system and enviroment are **external** interactions

# Work 

## Three üîë ingredients: **force**, **displacement**, and **cause.**

### In order for a force to do **work** on an object, there must be a _displacement_ and the force must _cause_ that displacement. 

---

# Work Equation 

![center w:700](image-4.png)

- $F$ is the force exerted on the system (N)
- $d$ is the distance over which the force is exerted (m)
- $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{F}$ and $\Delta \vec{x}$


$$ \boxed{W = F_{\parallel}d = Fd \cos \theta } $$

---

# Work

* Work is scalar, but can be negative
* $W$ has units of joules (J) which is equal to $1 \textrm{ N} \cdot \textrm{m}$
* Only force components parallel to $\Delta \vec{x}$ do work 

---

# Examples

| Work | No Work |
|---|---|
| Horse pulls a plow | A teacher applies a force to a wall and becomes exhausted. |
| A book falls off a table and free falls to the ground. | A waiter carries a tray full of meals above his head by one arm straight across the room at constant speed. |
| A rocket accelerates through space. | Water bottle sits on a table |

---

# Conservative and Nonconservative Forces 

* The work done by a **conservative** force exerted on a system is **path-independent** and obly depends on the intial and final configurations of that system (e.g., gravitational force)
  * For a conservative force, we include the source of the force in the system and associate that force with potential energy.
* The work done by a **nonconservative** force is **path-dependent** (e.g., friction and air resistance)

### Can we get that mechanical energy back?

# Conservation of Cake üç∞ <!--fit--->

## For Fiona's Birthday (Sat) we are cutting an imaginary birthday cake into 21 pieces


What changes? What remains constant?

Conservation of Mass:

$$\{ \textrm{initial cake mass} \} + \{\textrm{new mass enerting or leaving system}\} = \{\textrm{final cake mass}\}$$

<!---
- System lost mass
- Environment (hungry students) removed mass from the system
- If we expand the system to the classroom then our mass was conserved

# <!---fit---> Power üîã 

---

# Power

### **_Power_** is the rate at which work is done. 

$$P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{Fd}{t} = F\bar{v}$$

- Power is measured in Joules per second (J/s) which is equal to a Watt (W).

---

# <!---fit---> Power up the stairs

---

# Power up the stairs üèÉ üîã

1. Draw an energy bar graph for you moving yourself up the stairs. 
    - Consider: what is your initial and final energy? How can you simplify this motion?
2. Write an equation to determine the amount of work you do moving up the stairs.
3. Determine what you need to measure to calculate your power using the power equation: $P = \frac{W}{t}$ 
4. Go take your measurements in the hall and see who is the most powerful! 

---

# üö´ Rules:

1. Do not disturb classes or other students in the hall 
2. Spread out to the different staircases (there are 4 by my count) - no more than 2 per group 
3. No skippinng stairs
4. **BE SAFE** and use good judgement
