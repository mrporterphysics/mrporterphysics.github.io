# The Bungee Jumper

+ Represent this situation with as well as you can (with as many diagrams as you can)
+ Predict (using your physics diagrams or equations and your designated variables) the lowest height of the mass after it is released

Assume you know the spring constant and mass

# Hot Wheels Car:

On your whiteboards:

* Draw pie charts for where the energy is stored (in what object) at three snapshots:
  * when the launcher is pulled back all the way, but is not released yet
  * when the car is moving, but still touching the launcher
  * when the car is moving and no longer touching the launcher.
* If the energy is stored in more than one object, just divide the pie into slices

---

# Pull-back car

* Draw pie charts for where the energy is stored (in what object) at three snapshots:
  * when the car has been pulled back and is not yet moving
  * then two more when the car is moving and has not yet been stopped

---

# How the energy is stored

Energy is like money...



* **Kinetic Energy** - when energy is stored in ***motion***
* **Spring interaction energy** - energy stored when an object stretches or compresses a spring

---

# Nerf Dart Launcher

* Draw pie charts for how the energy is stored at three snapshots:
  * when the dart is compressing the spring and isn‚Äôt moving yet
  * when the dart has just left the gun (no longer touching spring)
  * when the dart is at the maximum height

---

# Pull-back car round 2

- Draw pie charts for how the energy is stored at three snapshots:
  - when the cart has been pulled back but is not moving
  - when the car is moving
  - when the car as stopped

# Energy Definitions

## Kinetic Energy:

* **Symbol**: $K$
* **When is the energy stored in this way?** When you have a moving object(s)
* **Notes**: Depends on mass and velocity

---

# Energy Definitions

## Spring Interaction Energy:

* **Symbol**: $U_s$
* **When is the energy stored in this way?** object stretches or compresses a spring or another elastic material
* **Notes:** Interaction energy is energy stored in the interaction of two objects. (i.e. Loaded nerf launcher without a dart)

---

# Energy Definitions

## Gravitational interaction energy:

* **Symbol**: $U_g$
* **When is the energy stored in this way?**: $\Delta y$ in a gravitational field
* **Notes**: Depends on $\Delta y$, a reference line ($y=0$), and the weight of the object

---

# Energy Definitions

## Internal Energy:

* **Symbol**: $Q$
* **When is the energy stored in this way?** particles have a faster random motion
* **Equation**: None
* **Notes**: Often referred to as change in thermal energy, but includes sound vibrations

---

# Energy Definitions

## Work:

_Work is a transfer of energy by a mechanical process (a force exerted on an object or system as it moves through a displacement in the direction of the force)_ The amount of energy transferred in this process is referred to as the work done.

## Work:

_Work is a transfer of energy by a mechanical process (a force exerted on an object or system as it moves through a displacement in the direction of the force)_ The amount of energy transferred in this process is referred to as the
work done.
* **Symbol**: $W = \Delta E$
* **When is the energy stored in this way?** External force changes the energy of the system
* **Notes**: Area of Force vs. Displacement Graph

# Conservation and Isolated System 

### **Isolated System**: System where there are no external forces

# Conservation of Cake üç∞ <!--fit--->

## For Fiona's Birthday (Sat) we are cutting an imaginary birthday cake into 21 pieces


What changes? What remains constant?

<!--- Cut cake into 20 pieces:
- Number of pieces did not remain the same
- Average piece size changed 
- total _mass_ remains the same --->

---

# Conservation of Cake üç∞ <!--fit--->

Conservation of Mass:

$$\{ \textrm{initial cake mass} \} + \{\textrm{new mass enerting or leaving system}\} = \{\textrm{final cake mass}\}$$

* What happened to the mass of our isolated cake system?

<!---
- System lost mass
- Environment (hungry students) removed mass from the system
- If we expand the system to the classroom then our mass was conserved

# Conservation of **Energy** <!--fit--->

# Conservation of Energy 

> Energy cannot be created or destoryed.

# Conservation of Energy 

## The energy of **an isolated system** remains constant.

# Work and Conservation

## Work-Energy Theorem 

* Always start by defining your object or system 
* The **net work** done by external forces changes the system's **mechanical energy** (Sum of potential and kinetic energies)

---

# Work and Conservation

## Work-Energy Theorem 

- Always start by defining your object or system 
- The **net work** done by external forces changes the system's **mechanical energy** (Sum of potential and kinetic energies)

$$W_{ext} = \Delta K + \Delta U$$
$$W_{ext} = (K_f - K_i) + (U_f - U_i)$$
