# Power

**Power** is the rate at which work is done. 

$$P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{Fd}{t} = F\bar{v}$$

- Power is measured in Joules per second (J/s) which is equal to a Watt (W).

# Power up the stairs 🏃 🔋

1. Draw an energy bar graph for you moving yourself up the stairs. 
    - Consider: what is your initial and final energy? How can you simplify this motion?
2. Write an equation to determine the amount of work you do moving up the stairs.
3. Determine what you need to measure to calculate your power using the power equation: $P = \frac{W}{t}$ 
4. Go take your measurements in the hall and see who is the most powerful!

# 🚫 Rules:

1. Do not disturb classes or other students in the hall 
2. Spread out to the different staircases (there are 4 by my count) - no more than 2 per group 
3. No skippinng stairs
4. **BE SAFE** and use good judgement
