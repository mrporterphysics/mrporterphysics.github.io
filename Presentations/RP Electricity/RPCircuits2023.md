# Current 

* The flow of charge
* By convention, flow is in the direction that positive charge carriers move 
    * But we now know that it is actually the electrons moving...

# Current

$$I = \frac{\Delta q}{t}$$


- I :arrow_right: Current (Amperes, A)
- q ‚û°Ô∏è: Charge (Coulombs, C)
- t ‚û°Ô∏è: time (seconds, s)

# Quick Practice 

1. 30 C flow through a 24 ohm resistor in 6 seconds what is the current? 
2. $2.5 \times 10^{15}$ elementary charges flow per second. What is the current?
3. Current through a light bulb is 2 amperes. How much charge flows through the light bulb in 1 minute?

# My Milkshake Brings All the Physics to the yard ü•õü•§üç®

## Consider:

In a speed milkshake drinking contest

- What advantages does your straw provide?
- What disadvantages does your straw provide?


---

# Straw as a Resistor

- How does length affect your sip rate?
- How does size (cross-sectional area) affect your sip rate?
- How does your milkshake's thickness (viscosity) affect your sip rate?

# Conductivity

* A material‚Äôs ability to conduct electrical charge
* Based on the materials:
    * Density of available free charges to move
* Mobility of those free charges


---

# Resistivity

* A material's ability to resist movement of electrical charge. 
    * Symbol: $\rho$
    * Measured in: $\Omega$ m
* based on the same properties as conductivity, but inverse 

---

# Electrical Resistance 

* The opposition of conductance of electrical current 
* Based on:
    * Materials Resistivity
    * Shape of material
    * Length of Material 
    * Temperature of Material 

---

# Electrical Resistance

$$ R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$

- $R$ ‚û°Ô∏è Resistance (Ohms, $\Omega$)
- $L$ ‚û°Ô∏è Length (meters, m)
- $A$ ‚û°Ô∏è Cross sectional area (meters$^2$, m$^2$)

---

# Quick Practice 

## A $3.5$ m length of wire with a  cross-sectional area of $3.14 \times 10^{-6}$ m at $20$ degrees C has a resistance of $0.0625$ $\Omega$. Determine the resistivity of the wire and what the material is made out. 

---

# Quick Practice 

The Electrical resistance of a metallic conductor is inversely proportional to its:

1. Temperature
2. Length
3. cross-sectional area
4. resistivity

---

# Quick Practice 

At 20 degrees C, four conducting wires made of different materials have the same length and the same diameter. Which wire has the least electrical resistance?
1. aluminum
2. gold
3. nichrome
4. tungsten

---

# Quick Practice 

## A length of copper wire and a 1 meter long silver wire have the same cross-sectional area and a resistance at 20 degrees C. Calculate the length of the copper wire. 

---

# Quick Practice 

## A $10$-meter length of copper wire is at $20$ degrees C. The radius of the wire is $1 \times 10^{-3}$ m. Find the resistance of the wire.

# Ohm's Law 

## Who is Georg Ohm?

- German Physicist who stared as a high school science teacher
- Researched the electrochemical cell and discovered the relationship between *voltage*, *current*, and *resistance*. 

---

# Ohm's Law Lab 

### üéØ: Find the relationship between *voltage*, *current*, and *resistance*

1. What is a circuit diagram?
2. How do we measure *voltage* and *current*

---

# Ohm's Law 

$$\boxed{R = \frac{V}{I}}$$

- $R$ ‚û°Ô∏è Electrical Resistance (Ohms, $\Omega$)
- $V$ ‚û°Ô∏è Voltage (Potential Difference) (Volts, V)
- $I$ ‚û°Ô∏è Current (Amperes, A)

---

# Ohm's Law 

$$\boxed{R = \frac{V}{I}}$$

* Resistance slows current flow 
* Voltage causes current flow 
* So they should have a mathematical relationship
