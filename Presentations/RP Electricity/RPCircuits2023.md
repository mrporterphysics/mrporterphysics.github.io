# Ohm's Law 

## Who is Georg Ohm?

- German Physicist who stared as a high school science teacher
- Researched the electrochemical cell and discovered the relationship between *voltage*, *current*, and *resistance*.

# Ohm's Law Lab 

### üéØ: Find the relationship between *voltage*, *current*, and *resistance*

1. What is a circuit diagram?
2. How do we measure *voltage* and *current*

---

# Ohm's Law 

$$\boxed{R = \frac{V}{I}}$$

- $R$ ‚û°Ô∏è Electrical Resistance (Ohms, $\Omega$)
- $V$ ‚û°Ô∏è Voltage (Potential Difference) (Volts, V)
- $I$ ‚û°Ô∏è Current (Amperes, A)

---

# Ohm's Law 

$$\boxed{R = \frac{V}{I}}$$

* Resistance slows current flow 
* Voltage causes current flow 
* So they should have a mathematical relationship

## Practice 

1. The current in a wire is 24 amperes when connected to a 1.5 volt battery. Find the resistance of the wire.
2. A 24 ohm resistor is connected across a 6 volt battery. What is the current in the circuit?

# Electrical Work & Power

$$ V = \frac{W}{q}$$

$$ W = Vq$$ 

$$ P = VI = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

$$ W = Pt = VIt = I^2Rt = \frac{V^2 t}{R} $$

# The Simple Circuit 

1. A source of electrical potential difference or voltage. (typically a battery or electrical outlet)
2. A conductive path which would allow for the movement of charges. (typically made of wire)
3. An electrical resistance (resistor) which is loosely defined as any object that uses electricity to do work. (a light bulb, electric motor, heating element, speaker, etc.)

# Kirchhoff's Laws:

1. The algebraic sum of the currents flowing through a junction is zero. Currents approaching the junction are + while currents going away from the junction are -.
    - i.e. Current in = current out 
2. The algebraic sum of the potential differences in a circuit loop must be zero.  Potential rises are + while potential drops are -.
    - i.e. around any loop in a circuit, the voltage rises must equal the voltage drops
    - Whatever energy a charge starts with at the beginning of the circuit is what it loses by the end.

# Series Circuit 

* A ***series*** circuit has more than one resistor (anything that uses electricity to do work) and gets its name from only having one path for the charges to move along. 
* Charges must move in "series" first going to one resistor then the next. 
    - If one of the items in the circuit is broken then no charge will move through the circuit because there is only one path. There is no alternative route. 
* Old style electric holiday lights were often wired in series. If one bulb burned out, the whole string of lights went off.

# Series Circuit 

Animation models electrical energy as Gravitational Potential Energy, the greater change in height, the more energy used, or work done.

# Parallel Circuit 

* A ***parallel*** circuit has more than one resistor (anything that uses electricity to do work) and gets its name from having multiple (*parallel*) paths to move along . 
* Charges can move through any of several paths. 
    - If one of the items in the circuit is broken then no charge will move through that path, but other paths will continue to have charges flow through them. 
* Parallel circuits are found in most household electrical wiring. This is done so that lights don't stop working just because you turned your TV off.

# Ohm's Law in circuits 

You can use the total circuit values:

$$ V_{total} = I_{total}R_{total}$$

OR You can use the partial values:

$$ V_{part} = I_{part}R_{part}$$

# Series Circuit Rules 

* Sum of potential drops equals the potential rise of the source:
    - $V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + \ldots$
* The current is the same **everywhere** in the circuit:
    - $I = I_1 = I_2 = I_3 = \ldots$
* The **equivalent resistance** or effective resistance of the circuit is equal to the sum of resistors
    - $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots$

---

# Parallel Circuit Rules 

* The potential drops of each branch equals the potential rise of the source.
    - $V_T = V_1 = V_2 = V_3 = \ldots$
* The total current is equal to the sum of the currents in the branches.
    - $I_T = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + \ldots$
* The inverse of the total resistance of the circuit (also called **equivalent resistance**) is equal to the sum of the inverses of the individual resistances. $\frac{1}{R_{eq}}= \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_{3}} + \ldots$
