# Some Definitions:

* **Tangential Velocity** - Instantaneous Lienar Velocity 
* **Angular Velocity** - How fast an object is rotating

---

# Tangential Velocity 

**Tangent** - a straight line that touches a curve at one point, but does not cross that point. 

You can think of this is a line parallel and touching a curve if you zoomed way in on a curve.

## Calculating Speed

$$v = \frac{d}{t}$$

$$v = \frac{2\pi r}{t} $$

# Self Check 🤳 ✅

During their physics field trip to the amusement park, Tyler and Maria took a ride on the Whirligig. The Whirligig ride consists of long swings which spin in a circle at relatively high speeds. As part of their lab, Tyler and Maria estimate that the riders travel through a circle with a radius of 6.67 m and make one turn every 8.21 seconds. Determine the speed of the riders on the Whirligig.

A barrel rider is moving in a circle with a speed of 8.0 m/s. The acceleration of the rider is 7.2 m/s/s. The speed of the object is somehow increased to 16.0 m/s (i.e., doubled). The new acceleration would be _____ m/s/s. (Assume that the radius of the circle is not changed.)

# Centripetal Force

* "_Center Seeking Force_" - The ***net force*** that causes an object to move in a circle.
* It is a ***special name for net force*** or the sum of all of the radial forces (forces along the radius of the circle) ***NOT AN ACTUAL FORCE***
* The net force that causes motion in a circular path
* Alters the direction of motion without altering the speed.

---

# Again...

The word “**centripetal**” refers to a *direction* and that it is always some external force, such as the normal force, gravitational force friction, or tension, exerted centripetally that allows an object to execute circular motion.

As a car makes a turn, the force of friction acting upon the turned wheels of the car provides centripetal force required for circular motion.

# Example

The maximum speed with which a 945-kg car makes a 180-degree turn is 10.0 m/s. The radius of the circle through which the car is turning is 25.0 m. Determine the force of friction and the coefficient of friction acting upon the car.

# Example

The coefficient of friction acting upon a 945-kg car is 0.850. The car is making a 180-degree turn around a curve with a radius of 35.0 m. Determine the maximum speed with which the car can make the turn.

$$F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

$$\mu F_N = \frac{mv^2}{r} \rightarrow (0.85)(9450\textrm{ N}) = \frac{v^2}{35\textrm{ m}}$$

# Some Proportions

$$F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

* For constant mass and radius, how is speed related to Centripetal force?
* For constant speed and mass, how is the radius related to the Centripetal force?
* For constant speed and radius, how is mass related to the net force?

# Summary

- Velocity is tangent to the circle and calculated with $v = \frac{2\pi r}{t}$
- Centripetal acceleration is towards the center of the circle and a calculated with $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$
- Centripetal Force is the sum of the radial forces (net force) and is calculated with $F_c = ma_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

## Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation

$$F_g = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

- $G$ = Universal Gravitational Constant ($G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \textrm{ Nm}^2/\textrm{kg}^2$)
- $m_1$ = Massive Object 1
- $m_2$ = Massive Object 2
- $r$ = Distance ***between the centers***

Calculate $G \frac{m_e}{r^2}$ near the surface of the earth

- Mass of Earth = $5.98 \times 10^{24}$ kg
- Mean radius of Earth = $6.37 \times 10^6$ m

Yo! it is about 9.8 N/m! I recognize that number!

At the instant shown, three asteroids are in a line, and the distance between A and B is twice the distance between B and C. Asteroid C has mass $M$. There is no net force on asteroid B due to the other asteroids.

![center w:1000](../figures/asteroids1.jpg)

Three students are discussing how they might find the mass of asteroid A:

---

**Ari:** *"We don't really have enough information to find the mass of A. Since there's no net force on B, the force from A has to cancel the force from C. To find the force on B from C, we'd use Newton's law of Universal Gravitation. But since the force is proportional to the produce of the masses we'd need to know both masses."*


---


**Bira:** *"I don't think we really need the mass of B. Asteroid A is twice as far away as C, so if it also has a mass M it will exert half has much force as C does. Since it has to exert the same force for the net force on B to be zero, it has to have twice the mass."*


---

**Cole:** *"It's true that A pulls on B to the left, and C pulls on B to the right, But you can't just use Newton's law of universal gravitation, because that only allows you to calculate the force between the two masses. here there are three masses, and asteroid A is exerting some of its force on B and some on C."*

**With which, if any, of these students do you agree?**
