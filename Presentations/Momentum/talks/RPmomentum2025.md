# Linear Momentum 

The ***linear momentum*** $\vec{p}$ of a single object is the product of its mass $m$ and velocity $\vec{v}$: 

$$\boxed{\vec{p} = m\vec{v}}$$

# Change in $\vec{p}$ and Forces

* Start with N2L: $\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}$

* Sub in definition of acceleration $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

* $\vec{F}_{net} = m \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \rightarrow \vec{F}_{net} \Delta t = m \Delta v$

* Rearrange and sub in $\Delta \vec{p}$ for $m \Delta v$ 
* $\boxed{\vec{F}_{net} \Delta t = \Delta p}$

---

# Impulse 

* Impulse is equal to the product of net force and the time interval
* $\Delta \vec{p} = m \Delta \vec{v}$
* Impulse is equal to the change in momentum of an object or system

$$ \huge{F} \tiny{\Delta t} \normalsize =  \Delta P $$

* Can make impulse changes with large *time intervals*:

# :1234: Calculating Momentum Change

#### Two ways:

- $\Delta p = m \Delta v$ 
- $\Delta p = F\Delta t$

#### Momentum Units:

- kg$\cdot$m/s
- N$\cdot$s

---

# üî¢ Calculating Momentum Change 

- We can combine the two equations for momentum change:

$$ J = F \Delta t = m \Delta v = m (v-v_0)$$

# Momentum conservation:

In general momentum of a system is conserved:

$$ \boxed{p_{before} = p_{after}} $$

Which can look like...

$$ \boxed{m_1\vec{v}_{1i} + m_2\vec{v}_{2i} = m_1\vec{v}_{1f} + m_2\vec{v}_{2f}}$$

# Collision Types

* Elastic  - Kinetic Energy is conserved, "*bouncy*"
* Inelastic - Kinetic energy is not conserved, "*sticky*"
* Explosions - Objects start together and *explode* away from each other

# Elastic Collisions

<!-- 
- Do not exist in nature
- Close with very rigid objects, sometimes super cooled metals can get there
- Collisions between atoms are almost perfectly elastic 
-->

# Inelastic Collisions

<!-- 
Examples:
- Volleyball bouncing off your arms, basketball dribbling, you jumping on a trampoline

These are most collisions

# Totally Inelastic *Sticky* Collisions

While gliding along, the puppy sees a squirrel and jumps off the back of the skateboard with a speed of *$0.5\text{ m/s}$* (backwards) relative to the ground. What is the speed of the skateboard just after the puppy jumps? (Be sure to keep careful track of all of the directions involved!)

Two brand new ice skaters have a collision on the ice. Esme, a *$21\text{ kg}$* skater, overestimated her new abilities and was gliding across the ice at an ambitious *$4.6\text{ m/s}$*. Octavia, a *$37\text{ kg}$* skater, who was blissfully unaware of Esme‚Äôs presence, was gliding in the same direction at a more modest speed of *$1.2\text{ m/s}$*. When Esme collided with the unsuspecting Octavia, she clung to her for dear life. At what speed did the pair end up traveling at together after the collision?

#### It‚Äôs moving day for Keanu‚Äôs family. A small dresser is strapped onto a rolling dolly, and Keanu is supposed to push the dresser out to the moving truck. Keanu is annoyed that they have to help, so instead they throw a *$300\text{ gram}$* rubber ball at the dresser. The ball is thrown with a speed of *$15\text{ m/s}$* and bounces straight back with a speed of *$10\text{ m/s}$*. Unfortunately, this only results in the dresser rolling at a paltry speed of *$0.21\text{ m/s}$*, and Keanu eventually decides to just push the dresser anyway. What is the mass of the dresser and dolly combo?

Explain your reasoning.

#### In a railroad yard, a train is being assembled. An empty boxcar, coasting at *$3\text{ m/s}$*, strikes a loaded car that is stationary, and the cars couple together. Each of the boxcars has a mass of *$9000\text{ kg}$* when empty, and the loaded car contains *$55,000\text{ kg}$* of lumber.

#### A *$50\text{ kg}$* cart is moving across a frictionless floor at *$2.0\text{ m/s}$*. A *$70\text{ kg}$* boy, riding in the cart, jumps off so that he hits the floor with zero velocity. What was the velocity of the cart after the boy jumped?

A bullet of mass $m$ is moving horizontally with speed $v_0$ when it hits a block of mass $100m$ that is at rest on a horizontal frictionless table. The surface of the table is a height $h$ above the floor. After the impact, the bullet and the block slide off the table and hit the floor a distance $x$ from the edge of the table. Derive expressions for the following quantities in terms of $m$, $h$, $v_0$, and appropriate constants:

![center w:700px](image-3.png)

1. the speed of the block as it leaves the table
2. the distance x

Suppose that the bullet passes through the block instead of remaining in it.

3. State whether the time required for the block to reach the floor from the edge of the table would now be greater,
less, or the same. Justify your answer.
4. State whether the distance x for the block would now be greater, less, or the same. Justify your answer.

A track consists of a frictionless arc $XY$, which is a quarter-circle of radius $R$, and a rough horizontal section $YZ$. Block $A$ of mass $M$ is released from rest at point $X$, slides down the curved section of the track, and collides instantaneously and inelastically with identical block $B$ at point $Y$. The two blocks move together to the right, sliding past point $P$, which is a distance $L$ from point $Y$. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the blocks and the horizontal part of the track is $\mu$ Express your answers in terms of $M$, $L$, $\mu$, $R$, and $g$.
