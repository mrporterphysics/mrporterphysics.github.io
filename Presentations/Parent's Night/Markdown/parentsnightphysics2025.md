# Standards Based Grading 


<div class="columns">

<div>

- Students graded by learning target 
    - _“I can solve projectile motion problems.”_
- Scored 1-5, Weighted Average (75% Most recent, 25% everything else)
- Can initial reassessments on any standard 
- Overall score is based on how many standards are mastered out of how many are assessed

</div>

<div>

| Descriptor | Score | 
|---|---| 
| Distinguished | 5|
| Proficient | 4|
| Developing | 3|
| Emerging | 2|

# Grades Overall AP/Regents

- 5%/10% Homework
- 15%/20% Tests
- 20% Lab Completion (Lab work in Lab Notebook and Pivot Interactives)
    - Labs must be completed thoughtfully and thoroughly. 
- 60%/50% Cumulative Standards Score 
    - Based on # of standards Mastered out of # assessed

# AP Physics vs. Regents Physics 

<div class="columns:">

<div>

## AP Physics

- Deeper conceptual understanding and a greater use of algebraic representation
- Tests how multiple concepts are related and the effect they have on each other
- Adds in Rotational Mechanics and Dynamics


</div>


<div>

## Regents Physics 

- More calculation based
- Tests one concept at a time and questions are scaffolded more


</div>

</div>

---


<div class='columns'>
<div>

#### <u>AP Physics</u>

1. Kinematics 
2. Translational Dynamics
3. Work, Energy and Power
4. Conservation of Linear Momentum
5. Torque and Rotational Dynamics
6. Energy and Momentum of Rotating Systems
7. Oscillations 
8. Fluids

</div>
 
<div>

#### <u>Regents</u> 

1. Kinematics

# Transition to NYSSLS 

## Earth Science Test has changed to match the New York State Science Learning Standards

<div class='columns'>
<div>

### New ESS

- Phenomena and systems driven, clusters around real-world contexts
- Shift towards scientific literacy and application

</div>
 
<div>

### Old

- traditional test, MC & FRQ
- Classic skills such as profiles, plotting, quantitative and recall items

</div>
