# Standards Based Grading 


<div class="columns">

<div>

- Students graded by learning target 
    - _‚ÄúI can solve projectile motion problems.‚Äù_
- Scored 1-5, Weighted Average (75% Most recent, 25% everything else)
- Can initial reassessments on any standard 
- Overall score is based on how many standards are mastered out of how many are assessed

</div>

<div>

| Descriptor | Score | 
|---|---| 
| Distinguished | 5|
| Proficient | 4|
| Developing | 3|
| Emerging | 2|

# Grades Overall 

- 15% Tests
- 25% (10% AP) Lab Completion (Lab work in Lab Notebook and Pivot Interactives)
    - Labs must be completed thoughtfully and thoroughly. 
- 60% (75% AP) Cumulative Standards Score 
    - Based on # of standards Mastered out of # assessed

# AP Physics vs. Regents Physics 

<div class="columns:">

<div>

## AP Physics

- Deeper conceptual understanding and a greater use of algebraic representation
- Tests how multiple concepts are related and the effect they have on each other
- Adds in Rotational Mechanics and Dynamics


</div>


<div>

## Regents Physics 

- More calculation based
- Tests one concept at a time and questions are scaffolded more


</div>

</div>

# What is Earth Science?

1. Origin of the Universe and Solar System
2. Earth's Interior and Plate Tectonics
3. Landscapes and Surface Processes
4. Geologic History and Evolution of Life
5. The Earth-Sun-Moon System
6. Weather
7. Climate

---

# Learning Process

1) ‚öìPhenomenon & Driving Question:
    * _"If we had to move off of Planet Earth where would we go?"_
2) Introduction to the performance task
3) Connecting Science Learning to Anchor and Performance Task
    * "Traditional Teaching" -> Labs, Notes, Quizzes, etc
    * Origin of Universe (_How did all matter in the universe come into exisitence?_)
4) Complete Performance Task
5) Unit Test

---

# Grading Policy

- Tests: 100 points (One test & One Performance Task per unit)
- Quizzes: 25-50 points (1-2 quizzes per unit)
- Labs: 25-50 points
- Homework and Classwork: 5-20 points (depending on length)

**Cumulative points will determine the final grade for the course.**
