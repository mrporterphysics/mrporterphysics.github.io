# A Wave...

> a *disturbance* or *variation* that **transfers energy** progressively from point to point in a medium and that may take the form of an elastic deformation or of a variation of pressure, electric or magnetic intensity, electric potential, or temperature.

---

# Initial Definitions 

* A *pulse* is a single vibratory disturbance which moves from point to point through a medium.
* A *wave* is several pulses generated at regular time intervals.

# Wave Classifications 

<div class="columns">

<div>

## Mechanical Waves 

- *Mechanical Waves* need a material medium to travel through 
    - i.e. medium such as water, string, air 
</div>

<div>

## Electromagnetic Waves 

- *Electromagnetic Waves* (such a light and radio waves) are periodic distrubances in an electromagnetic field and do not need a medium to travel through 
    - How the sun light gets to us through space!
</div>

---

# Wave Classifications 

<div class="columns">

<div>

## Longitudinal Waves 

- Particles in a *longitudinal wave* vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave motion.
- Examples:
    - Sound 
    - Seismic P-Waves
    - Slinky

</div>

<div>

## Transverse Waves

- Particles in a *transverse wave* vibrate perpendicular to the direction of waves. 
- Examples:
     - E&M Waves
    - Seismic S-Waves
    - Water Waves
    - Human Waves

</div>

# Wave Characteristics 


- The ***frequency*** ($f$) is the number of waves passing a point per unit time. 
    - Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz) or 1/s (s$^{-1}$)
- The ***period*** of a wave ($T$) is the time for one complete cycle to pass a point
    - It is the reciprocal of frequency. $T = \frac{1}{f}$, where $T$ is the period in second and $f$ is the frequency in hertz.

# Check Your Understanding 

What is the period of a $60$ Hz electromagnetic wave traveling at $3 \times 10^8$ m/s?

---

# Wave Characteristics 

- The ***wavelength*** ($\lambda$, greek lambda, "lamb-duh") is the distance between corresponding points in phase on successive waves. 
    - Measured in meters.

# Wave Characteristics 

The **amplitude** of a wave is related to the energy of a wave.

* In a transverse wave it is defined as the maximum distance above, or below, the wave axis (or equilibrium position)
* In a *longitudinal wave* it is determined by the *maximum displacement* of a particle.
* As the amplitude of a *light wave* increases the *brightness* of the light increases.
* As the amplitude of a *sound wave* increases the *loudness* increases

---

# Check your understanding

Draw the following 4 waves: A, B, C, and D

1. A has twice the amplitude of B and half the period of B. 
2. B has twice the amplitude of C and C has 5 times the frequency of B. 
3. D has the same period of A, but half the amplitude. 
4. A should be drawn with 2 full waves
