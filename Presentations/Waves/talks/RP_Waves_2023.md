# A Wave...

> a *disturbance* or *variation* that **transfers energy** progressively from point to point in a medium and that may take the form of an elastic deformation or of a variation of pressure, electric or magnetic intensity, electric potential, or temperature.

---

# Initial Definitions 

* A *pulse* is a single vibratory disturbance which moves from point to point through a medium.
* A *wave* is several pulses generated at regular time intervals.

# Wave Characteristics 


* The ***frequency*** ($f$) is the number of waves passing a point per unit time. 
    - Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz) or 1/s (s$^{-1}$)
* The ***period*** of a wave ($T$) is the time for one complete cycle to pass a point
    - It is the reciprocal of frequency. $T = \frac{1}{f}$, where $T$ is the period in second and $f$ is the frequency in hertz.

# Check Your Understanding 

What is the period of a $60$ Hz electromagnetic wave traveling at $3 \times 10^8$ m/s?

---

# Wave Characteristics 

- The ***wavelength*** ($\lambda$, greek lambda, "lamb-duh") is the distance between corresponding points in phase on successive waves. 
    - Measured in meters. 

![center](../figures/wavelength.jpg)


---

# Wave Characteristics 

The **amplitude** of a wave is related to the energy of a wave.

* In a transverse wave it is defined as the maximum distance above, or below, the wave axis (or equilibrium position)
* In a *longitudinal wave* it is determined by the *maximum displacement* of a particle.
* As the amplitude of a *light wave* increases the *brightness* of the light increases.
* As the amplitude of a *sound wave* increases the *loudness* increases

---

# Check your understanding

Draw the following 4 waves: A, B, C, and D

1. A has twice the amplitude of B and half the period of B. 
2. B has twice the amplitude of C and C has 5 times the frequency of B. 
3. D has the same period of A, but half the amplitude. 
4. A should be drawn with 2 full waves

# Wave Characteristics 

* The _**velocity**_ of a wave is determined by the medium it is traveling in
    * Example: Sound waves travel faster in water and solids than it does in air 
* Wave Equation: $v = f\lambda$ or $\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$
* For Electromagnetic (E&M) Waves: they move at the speed of light, $c$, in a vacuum.
    * $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s

# Constructive Interferece

- Occurs at points where path distances to the two different sources differ by an even number of half wavelengths.
    - This means a phase difference of 0¬∫ or 360¬∫ for maximum constructive interference. 

---

# Destructive Interference 

- Occurs when crests meet troughs or compressions meet rarefactions. 
    - This is where path differences to the two sources differ by an odd number of half wavelengths.
    - This is at 180¬∫ out of phase.

* ***Nodes*** appear to be standing still.
* ***Anti-nodes*** vibrate between the maximum amplitude above and below the axis.
* Standing waves are often produced by reflection of a wave train at a fixed boundary of a medium.
* Standing waves are the result of the interference of two waves.

# Resonance 

* *Resonance* occurs when one vibrating body sympathetically causes another body to vibrate. 
* *Natural frequency* is a particular frequency that a body will vibrate if disturbed. 
* Musical instruments can change notes by making different resonant frequencies.  They do this by changing the length of the ‚Äútube‚Äù that vibrates creating standing waves of different lengths.

# üåà Electromagnetic Spectrum 

* Light waves are electromagnetic waves!
* All E&M waves move through a vacuum at $3 \times 10^8$ m/s
* The <mark>*electromagnetic spectrum*</mark> is the complete range of frequencies and wavelengths of electromagnetic waves.

![center width:800px](../figures/emspect.png)

---

# üìè Some Facts 

* No sharp divisions between types of E&M waves.
* Classified by the methods that are used to generate them.
    * i.e. Radio waves are produced by charges accelerating in a wire.
* Microwaves are used in radar systems, for transmitting long distance telephone communications in space, and to cook food.
    * Microwaves that cook food produces a frequency that is the same as the natural rotational frequency of water molecules. 
* Infrared waves appear as heat when absorbed by objects. This is why we use infrared lamps to keep food warm!

---

# üìè More Facts

* Visible light is about 1% of the E&M spectrum.
    * Produced by the rearrangement of electrons in atoms and molecules‚Ä¶more to come later.
    * The human eye can see from ~400 nm to ~700 nm
* Ultraviolet light causes sunburn! Ouch!
* X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool by physicians
* Gamma rays are emitted by radioactive nuclei. It is harmful to living tissue.

---

# Waves at Boundaries

* When a wave hits a boundary three different things can occur:
    * ***Reflection***: Waves bounce off the boundary 
    * ***Transmission***: Wave is transmitted into a new medium
    * ***Absorption***: energy of the wave is transferred into the boundary medium

---

# Light and Rays 


* We can model incoming light waves as ‚Äúrays‚Äù or lines that represent the direction that our light wave is moving.
* When light interacts with objects several times larger than its wavelength, it travels in straight lines and acts as a ray 

---

# Law of Reflection 

<div class="columns">

<div>

* The angle that a light ray strikes a reflective medium is known as the *angle of incidence* or $\theta_i$
* The angle that a light ray reflects off of the medium is known as the *angle of reflection* or $\theta_r$
* The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence of a light ray is equal to the angle of reflection:
    * Mathematically: $\theta_i = \theta_r$</div>

# Law of Reflection 

## The *Normal Line* 

- The *normal line*, often referred to as the normal, is an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence.

# Specular Reflection 

* *Specular* (regular) Reflection: reflection off of smooth surfaces such as mirrors or a calm body of water.
* *Diffuse Reflection*: reflection off of rough surfaces such as clothing, paper, and an asphalt roadway.

# Refraction 

![center](../figures/Refraction_animation.gif)

> *Refraction* is the bending of the path of light when it travels from one medium to another.

---

# Refraction 

* When light hits a boundary a portion of the light is reflected and a portion of the light is transmitted into the new boundary.
* In the new boundary the frequency remains the same, but the speed and wavelength change.
* In the new medium the path of light is bent.

# Index of Refraction 

* Speed of light is dependent upon the *optical density* of the material that it is traveling through:
    - Does not depend on actual density of material 
    - Greater optical density the slower the speed of light 
* The indicator of optical density is a material's ***index of refraction***
* $n_{material} = \frac{c}{v}$
    - $n$ ‚û°Ô∏è index of refraction
    - $c$ ‚û°Ô∏è speed of light ($3\times 10^8$ m/s)

# What way does light bend?

* Light traveling from a fast to slow medium:
    - If light travels from a material with a low n to a higher n the light will bend towards the normal.
    - Example: Light traveling from air to water.
* Light traveling from a slow medium to a fast medium:
    - If a light travels from a medium with a high n to a lower n the light will bend away from the normal line.
    - Example: From Diamond to water.

* Remember $n = \frac{c}{v}$ which can be rearranged to $c = nv$
* So we can write Snell's Law as: $n_1v_= n_2v_2$
* Which can also be written as: $\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}$

# Wave Behavior Summary:

* *Reflection*: Waves bounce off of a new medium.
* *Refraction*: Waves bends in a new medium.
* *Diffraction*: Waves change direction of when traveling through an opening or around an obstacle. 

---

# ‚ùì Why is Diffraction Important?

* Newton believed that light was made of a stream of particles of called corpuscles. 
    * This was the corpuscular theory of light.
* Diffraction proved that light behaved like a wave. 

---

# Young's Double Slit Experiment

- The year was 1801‚Ä¶
- And Thomas Young proved that light behaved as a wave.
- A two-point interference pattern always has alternating pattern of nodal and anti-nodal lines.

# Diffraction 

* The amount of diffraction depends on:
    * Wavelength
    * Slit size
* The relationship for both are:
    * Larger wavelength = more diffraction
    * Smaller Slit = more diffraction
