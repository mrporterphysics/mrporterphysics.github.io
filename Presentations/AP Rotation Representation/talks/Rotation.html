#Lab Results:

####How is force related to the radius, mass, and tangential velocity?
--

Force is proportional to speed squared

$$F_c \propto v^2$$
--

Force is inversely proportional the radius

$$F_c\propto \frac{1}{r}$$
--

Force is proportional mass

$$F_c \propto m$$
--

Therefore,
--

$$F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

---

#Some Definitions:
--

- **Tangential Velocity**: instantaneous, straight line velocity
--

- **Centripetal**: center seeking
--

- **Centripetal Acceleration**: acceleration of an object moving in a circle
--

- **Centripetal Force**: force keeping an object in circular motion

---
###So how do I find Centripetal Acceleration?
--

Well,

$$a =\frac{\Sigma \vec{F}}{m}$$
--

and the centripetal force is doing the acceleration,

$$F_c = ma$$
--

and we know

$$F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
--
so,

$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

- How can we determine the coefficent of static friction between Einstein and the wall?
- Write your problem solving process down on your whiteboard

####Useful Equations:

$$F_c = ma_c =\frac{mv^2}{r}$$

$$|F_f|\leq |\mu F_N|$$

$$\bar{v} = \frac{d}{t}$$

##Al Problem Solving

1. Find the speed when he begins to slip
--

2. Draw a freebody diagram, determine which force is the centripetal force
--

3. We know know that `\(F_c = F_N\)` so `\(F_N = \frac{mv^2}{r}\)`
--

4. We also know that `\(F_f = F_g\)` which is `\(\mu F_N = mg\)`
--

5. Sub and Solve:

$$\frac{\mu m v^2}{r} = mg$$

#Angular Displacement:

- `\(\Delta \theta\)`: change in angle, measured in radians
--

- Is equal to the arc length divided by the radius
--

$$\Delta \theta = \frac{\Delta s}{r}$$
--

.center[<img src="https://cnx.org/resources/4bf1c18602c765189348b8e90ab8f780d6d2f128/Figure_07_01_01aa.jpg" width ="250"/>]
--

- One revolution is equal to `\(2\pi\)`

---

#Angular Velocity

- Measure of how fast an object is rotating.
--

- Symbol: `\(\omega\)`
--

- Is equal to the change in angular displacement in a time.
--

$$\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}$$
--

- measured in rad/s
---

##Angular and Linear Velocity

Angular velocity is analogous to linear velocity, and we can determine their relationship.
--

$$v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$$
--

and
$$\Delta \theta = \frac{\Delta s}{t}$$
--

so
$$\Delta s = r \Delta \theta$$
--

sub in:
$$v = \frac{r\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = r \omega$$

#Can Spinning things accelerate?

#Angular Acceleration

$$\alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}$$
--

- measured in rad/s/s or rad/s<sup>2</sup>

---

##What about a bug on the end of an accelerating wheel?
--

- There is linear (or tangential) acceleration
--
(ugh Mr. Porter)
--

- Derivation aside...

$$a_t = r\alpha$$

$$\alpha = \frac{a_t}{r}$$

##Equilibrium

- When there is no Fnet acting on the object.

--

- There is no net Torque acting on the object.

---

##Static vs. Dynamic equilibrium
--

- Static Equilibrium - angular and linear velocity is 0
--

- Dynamics Equilibrium - angular and linear acceleration are 0

---

##Torque:

- The rotational equivalent of force. Measures the effectiveness of a force changing or accelerating a rotation. "Twisting force"
--

- Torque is equal to force applied * lever arm
--

- The lever arm is defined as the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force.

##Rotational Dynamics:

- A net torque results in an angular acceleration.
--

  - (Just like a net force results in a linear acceleration)
--

- Linear acceleration is proportional to  net force `\(a \propto F_{net}\)` and inversely proportional to mass `\(a \propto \frac{1}{m}\)`
--

- So what do you think angular acceleration is proportional to? (Other than `\(\alpha \propto \tau\)`)
--

  - What makes it easier to spin something?

A student conducts an experiment to determine the relationship between torque and change in angular velocity. The student uses the apparatus
shown in the figure above, consisting of two disks that are glued together and mounted on a horizontal axle. Blocks of varying mass are hung
from a string wound around the smaller disk. The blocks are released from rest, exerting different torques on the disks, and are allowed to fall
a fixed distance. For each block, the time of fall `\(t\)` and the final angular velocity `\(\omega_f\)` of the disks are measured. There is considerable
friction between the disks and the axle. Which of the following best represents a plot that can be obtained from the student's data?]

A system consists of a disk rotating on a frictionless axle and a piece of clay moving toward it,
as shown in the figure above. The outside edge of the disk is moving at a linear speed v,
and the clay is moving at speed v/2. The clay sticks to the outside edge of the dusk.
How does the angular momentum of the system after the clay sticks compare to the angular momentum
of the system beofre the clay sticks, and what is the explanation for the comparison?

(A) Is is the same because there is no external torque acting on the system.

(B) It is greater because the rotating mass increases, which increases the rotational inertia.

(C) It is less because the speed of the disk decreases when the clay sticks to it.

Answer- To the right of *C*

--

Reasoning- For an explanation that the torque exerted by the disk or the angular momentum of the disk is greater when farther from the pivot

--

Example 1- The disk exerts a greater torque on the rod when it pushes the rod farther
from the pivot.

--

Example 2- The disk has greater angular momentum when it's farther from the pivot.
The disk loses almost all its speed during the collision and hence gives the rod
almost all its angular momentum. So the rod ends up with more angular momentum
when the disk hits it farther from the pivot.

Correct Answer - "Yes"

If "No" is selected, the explanation may still earn full credit if an incorrect selection was
made in part (a).

--

1 Point - For a selection consistent with the selection from part (a)

--

1 Point - For indicating that the equation shows that `\(\omega\)` increases with increasing `\(x\)`

--

Example- According to the equation, `\(\omega\)` increases with `\(x\)`; a bigger `\(x\)` produces a bigger
angular speed. This agrees with my reasoning from part (a), where I said a bigger `\(x\)`
creates a bigger angular speed after the collision.

## 2017 FRQ Q3C

--

3 Points

--

1 Point - For focusing on functional dependence (instead of, for example, considering
units/dimensions)

--

1 Point - For addressing `\(m_{disk}\)` , `\(I\)`, or both

--

1 Point - For correctly concluding that the equation is wrong because of the dependence on
`\(m_{disk}\)`, `\(I\)`, or both

--

Example -  If `\(m_{disk}\)` is large, then more angular momentum will be transferred during the
collision. But the equation shows the angular speed decreasing with increasing
`\(m_{disk}\)`, because it is in the denominator.

4 Points

--

1 Point - For using an expression of conservation of angular momentum for the disk and rod

Note: This point is not awarded for equating angular and linear momentum.

--

1 Point - For indicating that the initial angular momentum of the system is equal to `\(m_{disk}v_0x\)`

--

1 Point - For a dimensionally correct expression for the post-collision angular momentum that
includes `\(I\omega\)`

--

1 Point - For indicating the correct rotational inertia of the system after the collision: `\(I + m_{disk}x^2\)`

## 2017 FRQ Q3D
###Example

By Conservation of Angular Momentum


$$L\_{disk\_i} = L\_{disk\_f} + L\_{bar\_f}$$
--



$$m\_{disk}v\_ox = (I\_{disk} + I\_{bar})\omega$$
--



$$m\_{disk}v\_o x = (m\_{disk}x^2+I) \omega$$
--



$$\omega = \frac{m\_{disk}v\_0x}{I + m\_{disk}x^2}$$

## 2017 FRQ Q3E

2 Points

--

Correct Answer - Greater than

--

1 Point - For indicating, either directly or by analogy to the linear case, that the disk's angular
momentum with respect to the pivot changes more in the bouncy scenario than in
the original scenario OR for using a similar argument in terms of impulse

Note: This point is for describing what happens to the disk.

--

1 Point - For using conservation of angular momentum or momentum-impulse reasoning to
conclude that the rod gains more angular momentum, and hence more angular
speed, in the bouncy scenario

Note: This point is for describing what happens to the rod.

--

Example - After the bouncy collision, the disk has angular momentum in the clockwise
direction. To keep the system angular momentum constant, the magnitude of the
rodâ€™s counterclockwise angular momentum must be greater than before.
