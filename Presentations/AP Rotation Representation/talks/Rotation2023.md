# Translational Motion 

## _When an object moves as a whole from one location to another, without turning._

<!--- 
Car example:
- neglect wheels, engine, axles, etc 
- Car made a turn the radius was the same for everything...
- During turn certain parts move differently
- Modeled as a point

# Extended Bodies 

* Rigid (parts of object do not move with respect to each other)
* nonzero size

# Balance your <br> pencil ✏️ <br> on your finger <!---fit--->

# The balance point <br> is the pencil's <br> **center of mass**. <!---fit--->

# Center of Mass

## The point on an object where a force exerted on the object pointing directly toward or away from that point, will not cause the object to turn. The location of this point depends on the mass distribution of the object. 

---

# Center of Mass

## The average location of all of the mass of an object. 

- $F_g$ is effectively exerted on the center of mass
