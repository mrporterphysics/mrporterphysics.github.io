94,mc,Which of the following is a natural cause of climate change?,C,meteorology,"Natural events such as volcanic eruptions can cause climate change by releasing particles and gases that affect atmospheric transparency and temperature.","Urban development","Deforestation","Volcanic eruptions","Greenhouse gas emissions from factories","Agricultural practices",
95,mc,What causes high and low tides on Earth?,A,astronomy,"Approximately 70 percent of Earth's surface is covered by a relatively thin layer of water, which responds to the gravitational attraction of the moon and the Sun with a daily cycle of high and low tides.","Gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun","Earth's rotation alone","Changes in atmospheric pressure","Temperature changes in ocean water","Wind patterns",
96,mc,What type of rock is marble classified as?,B,geology,"Marble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to high heat and pressure, causing recrystallization.","Sedimentary","Metamorphic","Igneous","Biogenic","Volcanic",
97,mc,What is the primary factor that determines if precipitation falls as rain, snow, or sleet?,C,meteorology,"The temperature profile of the atmosphere determines the form of precipitation. If air temperatures are below freezing throughout the atmosphere, snow forms. If warm air overlies cold air near the surface, rain may freeze into sleet.","Wind speed","Air pressure","Temperature profile of the atmosphere","Humidity levels alone","Cloud height",
98,mc,Which of the following provides evidence of Earth's past climate conditions?,A,earth history,"Ice cores contain trapped air bubbles and other materials that provide evidence of past atmospheric composition and temperature, making them valuable records of Earth's past climate.","Ice cores from glaciers and ice sheets","Modern weather instruments","Computer climate models","Current sea levels","Satellite measurements",
99,mc,What process primarily shapes river valleys into a V-shape?,D,geology,"Streams (running water) create V-shaped valleys through the process of erosion. The gradient, discharge, and channel shape influence a stream's velocity and the erosion and deposition of sediments.","Wind erosion","Glacial movement","Plant growth","Stream erosion","Tectonic uplift",
100,mc,What causes seasons on Earth?,B,astronomy,"Earth's seasons are caused by its axial tilt of 23.5 degrees as it revolves around the Sun. This tilt causes different parts of Earth to receive varying amounts of solar energy throughout the year.","Varying distance between Earth and the Sun","Earth's axial tilt combined with its revolution around the Sun","Changes in the Sun's energy output","Changes in Earth's rotation speed","Ocean currents and wind patterns",
