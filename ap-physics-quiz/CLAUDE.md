- **Modular Design**: Each feature isolated in separate JS modules
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Fact sheet integration fails gracefully if unavailable

### **CSV Question Format (Enhanced)**

```
- **Topics**: kinematics, forces, energy, momentum, rotation, gravitation, shm, fluids, waves, general
- **Types**: tf (true/false), fill (fill-in-blank), mc (multiple choice), matching
- **Difficulty**: 1-3 scale (1=easy, 2=medium, 3=hard)

### **Adding New Questions**
1. Edit `data/ap-physics-questions.csv` following existing structure
2. Ensure proper topic assignment for automatic fact sheet linking
3. Questions automatically inherit fact sheet references based on topic and keywords
4. Test locally by refreshing page - questions load dynamically

### **Fact Sheet Integration Notes**
- **Automatic Linking**: Questions mapped to fact sheet sections based on topic + keyword analysis
- **Manual Override**: Specific mappings can be customized in `question-factsheet-mapping.json`
- **Modal System**: Accessible via keyboard (focus management) and fully responsive
- **Performance**: Lightweight JSON mapping loads once at application start

## Performance & Analytics

### **Current Performance Metrics**
- **Load Time**: <2 seconds for full application with 261 questions
