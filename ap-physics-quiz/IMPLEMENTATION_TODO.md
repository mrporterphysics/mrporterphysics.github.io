- [x] Completed full fact sheet with all 10 sections and comprehensive content
- [x] Enhanced data validation and robust error handling for quiz answers

**Phase 3 Statistics:**
- **Answer Validation Fixed**: Robust True/False checking handles malformed CSV data gracefully
- **Subject Selection Added**: Students can focus study on specific topics (Kinematics, Forces, Energy, etc.)
- **Complete Fact Sheet**: All 10 major AP Physics sections with detailed equations, definitions, and concepts
- **Enhanced UX**: Grid-based responsive design with hover effects and consistent styling

<!-- ## Phase 3B: Fixes after Phase 3

- [x] True/false questions -->

## Phase 4: Advanced UX Features ✅ **COMPLETED**

### ✅ Completed Achievements
- [x] Add question difficulty indicators and topic breadcrumbs to UI
- [x] Create topic mastery meters and progress visualization  
- [x] Add streak counters and personal best tracking for motivation
- [x] Implement question bookmarking and navigation features

**Phase 4 Statistics:**
- **Enhanced Difficulty Indicators**: Star ratings with color-coding (green/yellow/orange) and subtle animations for Level 3 questions
- **Improved Breadcrumbs**: Contextual navigation showing Course › Topic › Question Type with enhanced styling
- **Topic Mastery System**: Comprehensive progress tracking with visual meters for each physics topic
- **Streak Tracking**: Current streak and personal best counters with motivational feedback
- **Bookmarking System**: Full question bookmarking with export/import functionality and review mode
- **Visual Enhancements**: Upgraded CSS with drop-shadows, gradients, and smooth transitions

## Phase 5: Enhanced Learning Features ✅ **COMPLETED**

### ✅ Completed Achievements
- [x] Create detailed performance analytics by topic and question type
- [x] Implement the existing spaced repetition system fully
- [x] Add hint system with progressive help for struggling students

**Phase 5 Statistics:**
- **Advanced Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard with overall metrics, topic-specific accuracy bars, question type breakdowns, difficulty analysis, and learning trends
- **Spaced Repetition System**: Full SRS implementation with SM-2 algorithm adaptation, intelligent scheduling, progress tracking, and personalized review recommendations
- **Progressive Hint System**: Four-level hint system (concept → approach → formula → solution) with contextual physics guidance and usage analytics
- **Learning Intelligence**: Adaptive features that respond to student performance patterns and provide targeted support
- **Enhanced True/False Grading**: Fixed persistent grading issues with bulletproof string comparison logic

## Phase 6: Advanced Tools & Interactive Features ✅ **COMPLETED**

### ✅ Completed Achievements
- [x] Add rapid fire mode for quick formula and fact memorization
- [x] Create comprehensive study guides integrated with fact sheet content

**Phase 6 Statistics:**
- **Rapid Fire Mode**: High-speed memorization system with customizable focus (formulas/definitions/units/mixed), timing controls (5-15 seconds), and comprehensive statistics tracking
- **Interactive Setup**: Modal configuration with focus area selection, timing preferences, and gameplay options (timer display, auto-advance, pause on incorrect)
- **Real-time Performance**: Live countdown timer, streak tracking, score monitoring, and instant feedback with keyboard shortcuts (Space=submit, Arrow=skip, Escape=pause)
- **Comprehensive Study Guides**: Nine topic-specific guides covering all AP Physics 1 areas with key concepts, formulas, and problem-solving strategies
- **Integrated Learning**: Seamless connection between study guides, practice questions, and fact sheet references with topic-specific quick access

## Implementation Notes

### Fact Sheet Integration Strategy
1. **PDF to HTML Conversion**: Extract structured content from PDF
2. **Section Mapping**: Create unique IDs for each physics concept/formula
3. **Question Linking**: Add factSheetRef field to CSV data
4. **UI Integration**: Modal popups and reference buttons during quizzes

### Technical Considerations
- Maintain existing modular architecture
- Use CSS custom properties for theming consistency
- Implement progressive enhancement for advanced features
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design

### Success Metrics
- Student engagement time per session
- Concept mastery improvement rates
- Question accuracy improvements over time
- User satisfaction with fact sheet integration
