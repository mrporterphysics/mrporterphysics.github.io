# Coding Daily Plans 2018-2019

#2019.02.11 Coding

1. Status on Album Art - ?
2. Conditional Statements
3. Conditional Statement Assignment

---

#Conditionals - How can we get a program to take a different path?

##For example - can we change the color of a circle based on mouse location?

###We will look at:

- Conditional logical
- Boolean expressions - True or False

---

#Boolean Expression:

## 5 > 6 --> False

--

## 7 < 210 --> True

--

##Relational Operators `<, >, >=, <=, &&, ||`

---

##Conditional Expression

```javascript
if(mouseX<width/2){
  fill(255,0,0);
}

```

#2019.02.05 Coding

1. Color: RGB vs. HSB
2. Finish Emoji
3. First Project - Abstract Album Art:
  - You will pick a song or album and create a dynamic (it changes!) album cover that represents the mood, emotions, and feelings present in the song/album.
  - You should do your best to focus on representing these things with colors and shapes - for example, a dark, moody song might have a dark color palette. A song with a particular rhythm might have shapes in a pattern that mirror this beat.
  - **Requirements**:
      1. Use shapes that we covered in this unit"600px"
      2. Use built in variables that make your design dynamic (size or color changes with mouse position)
      3. Create & use custom variables to control two or more elements of your design
      4.Have your design change slightly each time it is run by using the random feature with some of your custom variables.(EX- have parts of your design move slightly each time the program is run, or shift slightly in color)
---

#2019.02.05 Color

- `colorMode()` is usually set to RGB, we can change this to the Hue-Saturation-Brightness model with `colorMode(HSB)`
- `colorMode(HSB)` goes in the `void setup(){}` part of your code
- Hue is the "color" from 0 (red) to 360 (red) like a circle
- Saturation is the amount of color from 0 to 100
- Brightness is the amount of light from 0 to 100

#Album Art Project

In Fine Art, we often use abstraction to represent complex feelings, emotions, and moods by using shapes, strokes, and convey those feelings.

For some people with a condition called synesthesia, this is how they experience the world all the time. While scientists don't completely understand synesthesia, the rare phenomenon causes people to experience two senses at once. For example, when people hear music, they might also "see" colors. Or when they taste a flavor, they might also hear a certain tone.

In this project, we are going to imagine that we all have synesthesia. You will pick a song or album and create a dynamic (it changes!) album cover that represents the mood, emotions, and feelings present in the song/album. You should do your best to focus on representing these things with colors and shapes - for example, a dark, moody song might have a dark color palette. A song with a particular rhythm might have shapes in a pattern that mirror this beat.

While it's natural to want to utilize text or images, we are only going to use the tools we have learned so far in p5 for this project.

Example on the next slide.

#What is p5.js?

- JavaScript Library for creating visual and interactive art (and more!)
- Works with *three* languages: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- This programming language will be used in this course to introduce basic programming concepts and apply them to create computational media by building expressive and interactive computer applications and media.

#Unplugged - Draw a Robot...


###You will use a graph that has the p5.js coordinate system to draw out a design, and write down instructions on how another person could draw them.

---

class:inverse

##Draw a robot...

Draw a robot using:

- Two shapes: ellipses and rectangles
- Up to 5 shapes total
- Place within a coordinate system

---

In p5 we use code to draw graphics on a canvas:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/visualoutcome.png" width = "700px"/>


---

The coordinate system is different...

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/coordinategrid.png" width = "700px"/>

---

Adjust your robot's coordinates:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/robot.png" width = "500px"/>



---

##Rectangles:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/heightwidthsquare.png" width = "400px"/>

##Ellipses:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/heightwidth.png" width = "400px"/>

---

#Write the info for your robot....

List the shapes and write down their information

#[Processing](https://processing.org/)

"Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping."

  - Free to download and open source
  - Interactive programs with 2D, 3D, PDF, or SVG output
  - OpenGL integration for accelerated 2D and 3D
  - For GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Android, and ARM
  - Over 100 libraries extend the core software
  - Well documented, with many books available

---

#[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

- Processing, but adapted for javascript
- means you can run it in your internet browser
- Also has an online editor and you can run it with your Chromebooks

---

#The Code

###Set up the windown
```javascript

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}
```

###A continuous loop
```javascript
function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```
