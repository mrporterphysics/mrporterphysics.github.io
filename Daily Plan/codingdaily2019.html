#`colors` array

.center[
<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_3/2.1/table.png" width = "1000px"/>
]

[Example](https://editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/zPPyXXzoQ)

---

#Test it out

Make a building

Your building can look any way you want – as long as it has three or more floors,
all different colors. And how do we store these colors? In an array, of course!
You can make each floor an ellipse, a rectangle, even a triangle.
But when it comes to using `fill()` to color each floor, remember -- you should be
getting the color value from your array.

Extensions:

1. How could you maybe use another array to make your code even easier to understand and more simple?
2. What other values are you changing for each floor?
3. Could you change the text used for colors to RGB values instead?
4. Is there a way to do that using one array instead of three?

---

###What does this do?

```javascript
var colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'white'];
var color1, color2;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  color1 = colors[floor(random(0, colors.length))];
	color2 = colors[floor(random(0, colors.length))];
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  rectMode(CENTER);
  fill(color1);
  rect(100,100,100,100);
  fill(color2);
  ellipse(300,250,100);
}

```

---
##Exercise - Fortune Cookie

Pick 10 fortune cookie messages from this [list](https://quotes.yourdictionary.com/articles/funny-fortune-cookie-sayings.html), store them in an array, and whenever the user loads the sketch, a different text message will be displayed.

##Extensions

Use `random()` and multiple arrays to create one of the following:

- Group pairing program - Create a program that randomly pairs students in your class in a group project.
- Mad lib generator - Create a program that randomly inserts words in an existing sentence to make it funny, surreal, or just plain weird.
- Bonus: Make it interactive. Update or modify the parameter(s) whenever you press play, click, or press a key.

---

##Looping

```javascript
var colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  for(i = 0; i < colors.length; i++){
    // Fill with the right color
    fill(colors[i]);
    // draw a rectangle
    rect(i * 100, height / 2, 75, 75);
  }
}
```

---

#Exercise:

Scientists have recently discovered a big advance in snowman-building technology.
Gone are the days of cheery stovepipe hats and coal smiles. Gone are the days of carrot noses.
Modern snowmen, like modern buildings, are one thing, and one thing only: tall.

Scientists have developed a way of creating 7-snowball-high snowpeople that are
colored in every shade of the rainbow. Your mission, should you choose to accept it,
is to create a rainbow snowman using one, and only one, for loop to determine both
the position of each ellipse, the size of each ellipse, and the color of each ellipse.
Your snowman should come out looking something like this.

###Extension:

Upon clicking, randomize or reverse the order colors or the sizes!

#2019.03.14 Coding

1. Complete Exercises:
  - Make a diagonal of circles
  - Use a second `for()` loop and create a 'X' out of circles
  - Make a line of circles that grow in size.
  - Use a loop to make a line of circles that gradually change color.
  - Use a loop to make an image of circles shrinking in size, and changing color. It should be a huge bull's eye that starts with a circle the size of your canvas and draws smaller ones on top.
  - Draw a smiley face, and then use a `for()` loop to draw multiple across the screen.
2. Nested `for()` loops

---

###Making a grid

```javascript
for(x=10;width > x;x=x+20){
  ellipse(x,10,15,15)
}
//create a column with x value 10 since the row begins with that x value
for(y=10;height > y;y=y+20){
  ellipse(10,y,15,15)}
//create a column with x value 30 since the next ellipse in the row was incremented by 20
for(y=10;height > y;y=y+20){
  ellipse(30,y,15,15)}
//create a column with x value 50 since the next ellipse in the row was incremented by 20
for(y=10;height > y;y=y+20){
  ellipse(50,y,15,15)}
//create a column with x value 70 since the next ellipse in the row was incremented by 20
for(y=10;height > y;y=y+20){
  ellipse(70,y,15,15)}


```

#Prompt

You recently have been hired by Microsoft’s design team to create 2 new wallpapers for their new line laptops. In order to boost sales and reach out to many different audiences, Microsoft would like these wallpapers to have some different color themes and use repetition. Be as creative and original as possible!

---

#Task
Create 2 variations of a desktop background using repeated elements. The design should be easily altered by changing the values in the for loop to create variations in the design.

---

#Requirements:

1. Your canvas size should be (800 x 450)
2. The program should include at least one for loop.
3. The for loop(s) should be used to increment values such as width, height, or color.
4. Variations should result from changing different values in the loop. Tthe designs should not only vary in color. Play with size, number of repetitions etc.
5. Save three different variations of the same design.


---

#Examples:

.center[

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_3/1.6/red.png" width = "800px"/>


<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_3/1.6/multicolor.png" width = "800px"/>
]

---

#Extensions:

###Randomize your wallpaper!

###Use the random function to generate variations of your wallpaper.

###It should randomize the size or color of the shapes while keeping the same design in place.

#2019.03.12 Coding

1. Loops
2. While Loops
3. For Loops

---

##Task:

Draw five circles on a horizontal line, 100 pixels apart from each other.

---
class:center, middle

---

###Now Draw them 50 pixels apart...

--

###Easy? Or tedious?

--

###There has to be a better way.

---

#Loops

##How we tell the computer to repeat itself, but change one aspect each time.

--

Look at your code for the 5 circles. What was similar and what was different about each line?

--

How could we simplify this code?

---

#Loops

1. Start at 100
--

2. If we haven't reached the edge of the screen
--

  - Draw ellipse
--

  - Move 100px to the right


---

#The Code

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#Three Steps For A While Loop

1. We declare and initialize a variable. Initializing a variable is setting the initial value for that variable, or where you want it to start. In this case, we would like to it begin at 100 pixels.
2. We check whether it meets a condition. The condition is inside the parentheses. We want to execute the code in the brackets on condition that x is still less than the width of the canvas.
3. We change the value of that variable in a way that will eventually make it meet the condition. In the code below, 100 is added to x inside the brackets. Every time the code is run x will increase by 100 until it's value is larger than the width of the canvas. Then the loop will be completed and the program will move on in the code.

---

#1. Initialize Variable

```javascript

*var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#2. Check Condition

```javascript

var x = 100;
*while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#Do the stuff

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
* ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#3. Iterate Variable

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
* x = x + 100;
}

```

#Change the code to draw  the bull's eyes up to the the position of your `mouseX`


---

##`for()` Loop

```javascript

for (var x = 100; x < width; x = x + 100){
  ellipse(x, 60, 40, 40);
}

```

##vs. `while()` Loop

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}
```

#2019.02.05 Coding

1. Color: RGB vs. HSB
2. Finish Emoji
3. First Project - Abstract Album Art:
  - You will pick a song or album and create a dynamic (it changes!) album cover that represents the mood, emotions, and feelings present in the song/album.
  - You should do your best to focus on representing these things with colors and shapes - for example, a dark, moody song might have a dark color palette. A song with a particular rhythm might have shapes in a pattern that mirror this beat.
  - **Requirements**:
      1. Use shapes that we covered in this unit"600px"
      2. Use built in variables that make your design dynamic (size or color changes with mouse position)
      3. Create & use custom variables to control two or more elements of your design
      4.Have your design change slightly each time it is run by using the random feature with some of your custom variables.(EX- have parts of your design move slightly each time the program is run, or shift slightly in color)
---

#2019.02.05 Color

- `colorMode()` is usually set to RGB, we can change this to the Hue-Saturation-Brightness model with `colorMode(HSB)`
- `colorMode(HSB)` goes in the `void setup(){}` part of your code
- Hue is the "color" from 0 (red) to 360 (red) like a circle
- Saturation is the amount of color from 0 to 100
- Brightness is the amount of light from 0 to 100

#Album Art Project

In Fine Art, we often use abstraction to represent complex feelings, emotions, and moods by using shapes, strokes, and convey those feelings.

For some people with a condition called synesthesia, this is how they experience the world all the time. While scientists don't completely understand synesthesia, the rare phenomenon causes people to experience two senses at once. For example, when people hear music, they might also "see" colors. Or when they taste a flavor, they might also hear a certain tone.

In this project, we are going to imagine that we all have synesthesia. You will pick a song or album and create a dynamic (it changes!) album cover that represents the mood, emotions, and feelings present in the song/album. You should do your best to focus on representing these things with colors and shapes - for example, a dark, moody song might have a dark color palette. A song with a particular rhythm might have shapes in a pattern that mirror this beat.

While it's natural to want to utilize text or images, we are only going to use the tools we have learned so far in p5 for this project.

Example on the next slide.
