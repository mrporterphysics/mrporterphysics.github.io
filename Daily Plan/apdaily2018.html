###2018.03.19 "Flipped Lab" Homework

[Force and Electric Charge 1: Force vs. Distance](https://www.pivotinteractives.com/activities/587fc3c832addb0011483253/preview)

1. Links are on Google Classroom - assignments are through "Pivot Interactives"
2. There are two assignments:
  - Determining the mathematical relationship between the electrostatic forced
  and distance.
  - Determining the mathematical relathionship between the electrostatic force and charge.
3. These will be due Thursday Morning (prior to school) so that I can prep the board meeting.
  - If you are going to be absent due to the field trip, you must arrange to meet with me **and** some of
  your peers (at least two others) to have a discussion about your results. Your assingment is still
  due Thursday morning.
