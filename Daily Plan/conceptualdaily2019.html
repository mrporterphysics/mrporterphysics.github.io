##On your own:

- Now that you have seen my examples of **Models** write down a few more of your own on your sheet of paper.

--
- Get into a group of 3 and compare your examples.

--
- Write down a list of your group's best examples of **models** on a whiteboard

--
- Consider how you are defining the word *model* as you make your list

---

class:center, middle

##Share model examples, compare and contrast differences. Make a list as a class of models.

---
class:center, middle

##Write down a definition of model with your group on your whiteboard.

---

#Are these examples of models based on your definition?

- a paper airplane
- observing a bird at a bird feeder
- making an analogy ("the heart is like a pump")
- forming a mental image of molecules in a liquid state
- going on a field trip to the Grand Canyon

####Learning Goals:
  - I can design a controlled experiment.
  - I can collect data for a controlled experiment.
  - I can analyze and present experimental results.
  - I can make predictions with experimental data.

1. Finish collecting ball bounce data.
2. Analyze your data (use the linear regression tool on Pivot)
3. Make a whiteboard to present your results for the board meeting:
  - What did you do? How did you run your lab?
  - What does the graph look like? What is the equation for your line?
  - Try to figure out what the slope and intercept represent for your lab.
4. Ball Bounce Board Meeting
5. Ball Bounce Predictions

**Homework:** Get saftey contract signed

##2018.09.11 Conceptual Physics

####Learning Goals:
  - I can design a controlled experiment.
  - I can collect data for a controlled experiment.
  - I can analyze and present experimental results.

1. Review your experimental data with your group.
  - Do you have enough data?
  - What does your graph show?
2. Make a whiteboard. On the _*BLANK*_ side present:
  - A summary of your experimental procedure.: What was your IV? DV? Experimental Design
  - What did you find: Present your results in way you view best.
3. Post-game analysis:
  - What went well in the lab?
  - What would we change if we did this lab again? What will be make sure we do for future labs?
4. Ball Bounce Lab:
  - _What is the relationship between the drop height of your ball and its resulting bounce height?_
