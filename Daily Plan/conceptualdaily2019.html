##On your own:

- Now that you have seen my examples of **Models** write down a few more of your own on your sheet of paper.

--
- Get into a group of 3 and compare your examples.

--
- Write down a list of your group's best examples of **models** on a whiteboard

--
- Consider how you are defining the word *model* as you make your list

---

class:center, middle

##Share model examples, compare and contrast differences. Make a list as a class of models.
