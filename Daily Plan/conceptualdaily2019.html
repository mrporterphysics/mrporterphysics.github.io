#2018.10.3 Conceputal Physics

1. What is a scientific model?
2. How do we describe motion?
3. Practice with describing motion
4. Interpreting position vs. time graphs 

---

#Examples of "Models"

#$$\vec{F}_g = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

##On your own:

- Now that you have seen my examples of **Models** write down a few more of your own on your sheet of paper.

--
- Get into a group of 3 and compare your examples.

--
- Write down a list of your group's best examples of **models** on a whiteboard

--
- Consider how you are defining the word *model* as you make your list

---

class:center, middle

##Share model examples, compare and contrast differences. Make a list as a class of models.

---
class:center, middle

##Write down a definition of model with your group on your whiteboard.

---

#Are these examples of models based on your definition?

- a paper airplane
- observing a bird at a bird feeder
- making an analogy ("the heart is like a pump")
- forming a mental image of molecules in a liquid state
- going on a field trip to the Grand Canyon

##Buggy Lab Round 2:

###Board Meeting Questions to Consider:

- What does your slope represent?
- What does your intercept represent?
- How does you graph differ from the other groups graphs?
- Why is a position-time graph better information than distance-time graphs?


---
#2018.09.27 Conceptual Phyiscs

1. Review distance, time, speed
2. How can we predict where our buggy will be?
3. Repeat Buggy Lab -- time as the independent variable

---

##2018.09.25 Conceputual Physics:

1. Ping Pong Cannon - Graph it
2. Discuss Video Analysis
3. Buggy Lab - Round 2

---

class: center, middle

#What does the slope of your graph tell us?

---

class: center, middle

#What does the intercept tell us?

---

##2018.09.21 Conceptual Physics

1. Analyze Buggy Lab Results
2. Buggy Lab Board Meeting
3. Pivot Video Task: Ping Pong Cannon


---

##2018.09.17 Conceptual Physics

1. Ball Bounce Board meeting
2. Buggy Lab: Does your buggy move in a consistent manner

---

##2018.09.13

####Learning Goals:
  - I can design a controlled experiment.
  - I can collect data for a controlled experiment.
  - I can analyze and present experimental results.
  - I can make predictions with experimental data.

1. Finish collecting ball bounce data.
2. Analyze your data (use the linear regression tool on Pivot)
3. Make a whiteboard to present your results for the board meeting:
  - What did you do? How did you run your lab?
  - What does the graph look like? What is the equation for your line?
  - Try to figure out what the slope and intercept represent for your lab.
4. Ball Bounce Board Meeting
5. Ball Bounce Predictions

**Homework:** Get saftey contract signed

##2018.09.11 Conceptual Physics

####Learning Goals:
  - I can design a controlled experiment.
  - I can collect data for a controlled experiment.
  - I can analyze and present experimental results.

1. Review your experimental data with your group.
  - Do you have enough data?
  - What does your graph show?
2. Make a whiteboard. On the _*BLANK*_ side present:
  - A summary of your experimental procedure.: What was your IV? DV? Experimental Design
  - What did you find: Present your results in way you view best.
3. Post-game analysis:
  - What went well in the lab?
  - What would we change if we did this lab again? What will be make sure we do for future labs?
4. Ball Bounce Lab:
  - _What is the relationship between the drop height of your ball and its resulting bounce height?_

---

##2018.09.07 Conceptual Physics



1. Lab Grouping
2. Fill out handout
2. On the back of your index card:
  - Your name:
  - One (or more!) thing that you are good at
2. Pasta Bridge Lab introduction
3. Pasta Bridge Lab
