####Calculated Estimation - As a lab group, on your whiteboard

How far do you travel when you text 'lol' while driving on Maple Hill Road and then react to an object in your path and slam on the brakes?

Assumptions:

- You have to read and respond to a text message
- You are driving at Maple Hill Road (speed limit 18 m/s)
- You can brake with an acceleration of 5 m/s/s

Use graphs, diagrams, and equations to explain your answer.

##Linearizing


What do we do when our data is non-linear?

--

- We turn it into a line!

--
- How? By applying a mathematical operation to one of our variables and replotting our graph

--


Let's get our notebooks out and copy down this chart...

Pivot data

General Model:

$$x = (\frac{1}{2}a)t^2 + x_0$$

--

Specific Model:

$$x = (28.5 \textrm{ cm/s}^2)t^2 + 6.03 \textrm{ cm}$$

##Linear Modeling


###Ball Bounce Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."

--
- What does the intercept mean?

---

##Test Your Model

### Test 1:

- Put two stools together and place a meter stick across them
- Predict where to drop your ball so it bounces up to the meter sticks
- Use your model -- not a data point that may happen to coincidentally match

--

### Test 2:

- In the MUF Perry will go up on the lift and drop your ball from the ceiling
- Take a video (does not need to be slow motion) so that you can get the entire drop and bounce in the video.
- Using tools in pivot compare the actual measured bounce height (from the video) to what your linear model predicted
- Put your results on your whiteboard

##.gray[2022.09.09] .blue[AP Physics] .red[Do Now]


In your notebook (or a scrap piece of paper if you don't have one) answer the following prompts:
  - *What is a scientific model?*
  - *How do you make a scientific model?*
  - *How do you use a scientific model?*

---

###From Wikipedia:

*Scientific modelling is a scientific activity, the aim of which is to make a particular part or feature of the world easier to understand, define, quantify, visualize, or simulate by referencing it to existing and usually commonly accepted knowledge.*

--

###John von Neumann

*... the sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work‚Äîthat is, correctly to describe phenomena from a reasonably wide area.*

##Ball Bounce Lab üèÄ

####üéØ The goal for this lab is to create a mathematical model that can be used to predict bounce height for a given drop height of your ball. Design an experiment to determine this relationship. Consider:

  - What quantity will you vary?
  - Which quantities will you hold constant?
  - What quantities will you measure? How will you measure them? What tools will you use to measure these quantities?
  - What will you plot?

#Question of the Day:

#.blue[Sweet or savory for breakfast?]

---

#Lab Grouping

Arrange yourself into ***logical*** lab groups based on the word on your card.


**Rules:**

The class must have

- 6 Groups of 3

---

class: center, middle

#Why? What connections to physics class?

---


#Why?

--

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (need to see more cards)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated
--

- constrain the variables (set number of groups with specific sizing)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat

---

#Survival Island üèùÔ∏è

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island üòÆ!

--

Using *each* of your <u>unique skill's</u> develop a plan to escape the island.

--

Whiteboard your response (one person)


--

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.

#Marshmallow Challenge

- ‚è≥ 18 Minutes
- 20 sticks of spaghetti
- 1 meter of string
- 1 meter of masking tape

üéØ Build the tallest structure with with a marshmallow on top

#What can we learn from this?

Discuss at your table some takeaways

--

- Kids (like kindergarteners) often outperform business graduate students! Why?
--

  - Lesson: prototype and fail early and often, learn from your earlier experiences and grown
--

- The marshmallow - what about it?
--

  - Lesson: Represents our hidden assumptions, we need to go out on a limb with our ideas and thoughts and test them
--

  - You have preconceptions about physics

---

#Materials for AP Physics

- 3 Ring Binder for Handouts
    - Handouts will be paged numbered, you will ***not*** just shove these in a folder
- Notebook - need one
    - I *recommend* a bound, graph ruled notebook. You will thank me with all of the graphs and diagrams that you will be sketching this year
    - You will use this for labs, notes, do nows, homework, etc
