1. Porter Packet - 2.3 Projectile Motion Ranking Task
2. Solving Horizontal Projectile Motion Problems
3. Porter Packet 2.3 Horizontally Fired Projectiles


---

##Horizontally Fired Projectiles

Examples of this type of problem are

- A pool ball leaves a 0.60-meter high table with an initial horizontal velocity of 2.4 m/s. Predict the time required for the pool ball to fall to the ground and the horizontal distance between the table's edge and the ball's landing location.
- A soccer ball is kicked horizontally off a 22.0-meter high hill and lands a distance of 35.0 meters from the edge of the hill. Determine the initial horizontal velocity of the soccer ball.

---

##Problem-Solving Approach


1. Use the given values of the initial velocity (the magnitude and the angle) to determine the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity (`\(v_{0x}\)` and `\(v_{0y}\)`).
--

2. Carefully read the problem and list known and unknown information in terms of the symbols of the kinematic equations. For convenience sake, make a table with horizontal information on one side and vertical information on the other side.
--

3. Identify the unknown quantity that the problem requests you to solve for.
--

4. Select either a horizontal or vertical equation to solve for the time of flight of the projectile. For non-horizontally launched projectiles, the second equation listed among the vertical equations (`\(v_{y} = v_{0y} + a_y t\)`) is usually the most useful equation.
--

5. With the time determined, use a horizontal equation (usually `\(\Delta x = v_{0x}t + \frac{1}{2}a_x t^2\)` ) to determine the horizontal displacement of the projectile.
--

6. Finally, the peak height of the projectile can be found using a time value that is one-half the total time of flight. The most useful equation for this is usually `\(\Delta y = v_{0y}t +\frac{1}{2}a_yt^2\)`.

---

##Solving the Examples:

[Jamboard Link (Notes)](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1inujPo8RHyBy5tjz98HmUns9DaEFU5YdGc-hmE3tc_0/edit?usp=sharing)

- A pool ball leaves a 0.60-meter high table with an initial horizontal velocity of 2.4 m/s. Predict the time required for the pool ball to fall to the ground and the horizontal distance between the table's edge and the ball's landing location.
- A soccer ball is kicked horizontally off a 22.0-meter high hill and lands a distance of 35.0 meters from the edge of the hill. Determine the initial horizontal velocity of the soccer ball.


---

##Mini Lab

1. Make measurements to calculate the speed at which you ball leaves the table using only a meterstick.
2. Using this launch velocity, go to a different height and predict the landing spot of your ball.

2. Whiteboard Results (3 Graphs) - provide equation for anything linear
3. What is a projectile?
4. Solving Freefall problems
5. Determine your reaction time with a ruler

---

##Solving Freefall Problems

--

- Projectiles & Objects in Free Fall accelerate at `\(\vec{g}\)`
--

  - The magnitude of `\(g\)` is 9.8 m/s/s or often rounded to 10 to ease calculations
  - The direction is **always** towards earth which is *often* but not always negative (negative indicates downward)
--

- If the object is dropped `\(v_0 = 0\)` m/s
--

- When thrown straight up, the (vertical) velocity at the objects highest point is 0 m/s
--

  - This means you can make `\(v_f\)` = 0 if you are solving for something at the peak (time to highest point, max height, etc)
--

- If an object is projected upwards in a perfectly vertical direction, then the velocity at which it is projected is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the velocity that it has when it returns to the same height. That is, a ball projected vertically with an upward velocity of +30 m/s will have a downward velocity of -30 m/s when it returns to the same height.
--

- You can often avoid the quadratic formula by finding additional quantities and using an equation other than `\(x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2\)`

#Vectors & Vector Math


###A *<u>vector</u>* is a quantity with both *magnitude* (size) and *direction*.

--

Examples:

  - The child was displaced 9 meters North.
  - The car has a velocity of 10 meters per second East

--

###A *<u>scalar</u>* is a quantity with just *magnitude*.

--

Examples:

  - The child traveled a distance of 12 meters
  - The car is moving 20 miles per hour
  - The frog has mass of 0.5 kg.

##Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

####ABCD: Answer, Basic Physics, Cite information, Draw it together

--

**Answer the Question** (Claim)

--

- DO: State whether something increases, decreases, or stays the same.
  - If given two or more cases to choose from, state which case answers the question, or clearly state that both cases are the same.

--
- DON'T: Just say that something ‚Äúchanges‚Äù. We need to know how it changes. Talk about how it could be either case or both. You need to commit to an answer.

---

##Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

####ABCD: Answer, Basic Physics, Cite information, Draw it together

**Basic Physics** (Evidence)

--

- Your explanation needs to include at least one statement of basic physics. You'll know that this is a statement of basic physics because a statement of basic physics is true all the time, every day, and in all situations. Basic physics can be the name of a law of physics, like "Newton‚Äôs Third Law", or it can be a statement of the law itself, such as "when the horse pulls the cart, the cart pulls back on the horse with the same force."

---

##Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

####ABCD: Answer, Basic Physics, Cite information, Draw it together


**Cite Important Information** (Evidence)

--

- This is when you point out important aspects of this particular situation that are relevant to your explanation. The Cite Information sentence should start with the words ‚Äúin this situation‚Äù or ‚Äúin Case 1‚Äù or ‚Äúfor the small cart, ...‚Äù and proceed to say something about the particular problem you are presented with.

--

**Draw It All Together** (Reasoning)

--

- This is when you take your statements of basic physics and the important information that you cited from this situation and show how it logically leads to the correct answer. Depending on how well you do your B‚Äôs and C‚Äôs, your ‚ÄúDraw it Together‚Äù might only be a single sentence.

---

##More Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

- Do NOT use "it", "they", "them". Use good nouns (you know the words on your reference table)

--
- Use good verbs that talk about what the nouns are doing
  - (Objects will speed up, slow down, change direction, gain/lose/transfer energy, gain/lose/transfer momentum, exert or experience forces, etc.)

--
- You do not need to restate the question.

--
- Don't write more than you mean to

--
- Don't write just "force" - state the specific force

--
- Don't write "it moves"!!

#Derive an Expression

From College Board: *"Derive is more specific and indicates that the students need to begin their solutions with one or more fundamental
equations, such as those given on the AP Physics Exam equation sheet. The final answer, usually algebraic, is then
obtained through the appropriate use of mathematics."*

---

###Why?

1. The numbers are not as important as the general relationship.
2. A general relationship can be used to generate many answers to many possible situations and allow for a wider range of predictions to be made (i.e. a graph instead of a single number).
3. A general relationship unveils the functional dependence of one variable on another (i.e. how does increasing the mass change the acceleration?).
4. We get cleaner and better answers.
5. It‚Äôs easier than messing with numbers (once you get the hang of it).

---

###Steps:

**Step 1:** Identify what is being asked and what they give you. The difference is now instead of numbers you will get variables (ex. An object is at position `\(D\)`  at time `\(t_D\)`. This means you would use `\(D\)`  for `\(\Delta x \)` )

--

**Step 2:** Start with equations from the reference table in their reference table form! Then substitue in your variables from Step 1. (`\(v^2 = v_0 + 2a(x-x_0)\)` becomes `\(v^2 = 2aD\)`)

--

**Step 3:** Solve for specific variables, combine equations and simplify algebraically.

--

Annotate the steps you are making "i.e solve for `\(t\)`" or substitute X.

---

##Lets Try It

A ball is dropped from the top of a building of height `\(H\)`. The ball accelerates at `\(g\)`. Derive an expression for the time, `\(t_{fall}\)` that it takes for the ball to reach the ground.

---

##Lets Try It

A blue car is at rest at a stoplight. The moment the stoplight turns green, a red car passes it moving with a constant
speed of `\(v_R\)`. The blue car accelerates uniformly at a rate of `\(a_B\)`. How much time, `\(t_e\)` elapses before the blue
car catches up with the red car?


---

##Lets Try It


.center[<img src="images/ramppractical.png" width = "800 px"/>]

A cart is released from rest a distance of `\(\Delta x_1\)` from the first of two photo gates. You must change the distance between the two photogates so that the time it takes for the cart to travel between the two games is `\(t\)`. Derive an equation for `\(\Delta x_2\)` in terms of `\(a\)`, `\(\Delta x_1\)`, and `\(t\)`.

##Linear Modeling


###Ball Bounce Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."

--
- What does the intercept mean?

---

##Test Your Model

### Test 1:

- Put two stools together and place a meter stick across them
- Predict where to drop your ball so it bounces up to the meter sticks
- Use your model -- not a data point that may happen to coincidentally match

--

### Test 2:

- In the MUF Perry will go up on the lift and drop your ball from the ceiling
- Take a video (does not need to be slow motion) so that you can get the entire drop and bounce in the video.
- Using tools in pivot compare the actual measured bounce height (from the video) to what your linear model predicted
- Put your results on your whiteboard

##.gray[2022.09.09] .blue[AP Physics] .red[Do Now]


In your notebook (or a scrap piece of paper if you don't have one) answer the following prompts:
  - *What is a scientific model?*
  - *How do you make a scientific model?*
  - *How do you use a scientific model?*

---

###From Wikipedia:

*Scientific modelling is a scientific activity, the aim of which is to make a particular part or feature of the world easier to understand, define, quantify, visualize, or simulate by referencing it to existing and usually commonly accepted knowledge.*

--

###John von Neumann

*... the sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work‚Äîthat is, correctly to describe phenomena from a reasonably wide area.*

##Ball Bounce Lab üèÄ

####üéØ The goal for this lab is to create a mathematical model that can be used to predict bounce height for a given drop height of your ball. Design an experiment to determine this relationship. Consider:

  - What quantity will you vary?
  - Which quantities will you hold constant?
  - What quantities will you measure? How will you measure them? What tools will you use to measure these quantities?
  - What will you plot?

#Lab Grouping

Arrange yourself into ***logical*** lab groups based on the word on your card.


**Rules:**

The class must have

- 6 Groups of 3

---

class: center, middle

#Why? What connections to physics class?

---


#Why?

--

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (need to see more cards)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated
--

- constrain the variables (set number of groups with specific sizing)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat

---

#Survival Island üèùÔ∏è

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island üòÆ!

--

Using *each* of your <u>unique skill's</u> develop a plan to escape the island.

--

Whiteboard your response (one person)


--

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.

#What can we learn from this?

Discuss at your table some takeaways

--

- Kids (like kindergarteners) often outperform business graduate students! Why?
--

  - Lesson: prototype and fail early and often, learn from your earlier experiences and grown
--

- The marshmallow - what about it?
--

  - Lesson: Represents our hidden assumptions, we need to go out on a limb with our ideas and thoughts and test them
--

  - You have preconceptions about physics

#Materials for AP Physics

- 3 Ring Binder for Handouts
    - Handouts will be paged numbered, you will ***not*** just shove these in a folder
- Notebook - need one
    - I *recommend* a bound, graph ruled notebook. You will thank me with all of the graphs and diagrams that you will be sketching this year
    - You will use this for labs, notes, do nows, homework, etc
