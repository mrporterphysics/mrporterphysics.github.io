#Hot Wheels Car:

On your whiteboards:

- Draw pie charts for where the energy is stored (in what object) at three snapshots:
  - when the launcher is pulled back all the way, but is not released yet
  - when the car is moving, but still touching the launcher
  - when the car is moving and no longer touching the launcher.
- If the energy is stored in more than one object, just divide the pie into slices

---

#Pull-back car

- Draw pie charts for where the energy is stored (in what object) at three snapshots:
  - when the car has been pulled back and is not yet moving
  - then two more when the car is moving and has not yet been stopped

---

#How the energy is stored

Energy is like money...

--

- **Kinetic Energy** - when energy is stored in *motion*
- **Spring interaction energy** - energy stored when an object stretches or compresses a spring

---

#Nerf Dart Launcher

- Draw pie charts for how the energy is stored at three snapshots:
  - when the dart is compressing the spring and isn‚Äôt moving yet
  - when the dart has just left the gun (no longer touching spring)
  - when the dart is at the maximum height

---

#Pull-back car round 2

- Draw pie charts for how the energy is stored at three snapshots:
  - when the cart has been pulled back but is not moving
  - when the car is moving
  - when the car as stopped

#Energy Definitions

##Kinetic Energy:

- **Symbol**: `\(K\)`
--

- **When is the energy stored in this way?** When you have a moving object(s)
--

- **Equation**: `\(K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)`
--

- **Notes**: Depends on mass and velocity

---

#Energy Definitions

##Spring Interaction Energy:

- **Symbol**: `\(U_s\)`
--

- **When is the energy stored in this way?** object stretches or compresses a spring or another elastic material
--

- **Equation**: `\(U_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \)`
--

- **Notes:** Interaction energy is energy stored in the interaction of two objects. (i.e. Loaded nerf launcher without a dart)

---

#Energy Definitions

##Gravitational interaction energy:

- **Symbol**: `\(U_g\)`
--

- **When is the energy stored in this way?**: `\(\Delta y\)` in a gravitational field
--

- **Equation**: `\(U_g = mg\Delta y \)`
--

- **Notes**: Depends on `\(\Delta y\)`, a reference line (`\(y=0\)`), and the weight of the object

---

#Energy Definitions

##Internal Energy:

- **Symbol**: `\(Q\)`
--

- **When is the energy stored in this way?** particles have a faster random motion
--

- **Equation**: None
--

- **Notes**: Often refered to as change in thermal energy, but includes sound vibrations


---

#Energy Definitions

##Work:

- **Symbol**: `\(W = \Delta E\)`
--

- **When is the energy stored in this way?** External force changes the energy of the system
--

- **Equation**: `\(\Delta E = W = F_\parallel d = Fd\cos\theta\)`
--

- **Notes**: Area of Force vs. Displacement Graph

#Flying Pigs

.right-column-long[The buffalo farm has recently acquired some flying animals and needs to test the length of the flying animals' leashes. The farm is trying to find a way to predict how long it takes for
the animals to complete one circle while attached to their loop (in physics we call this the "period" or time for one event of repeating events to happen and use the symbol `\(T\)`.) **Your goal is to predict
the time it takes for your animal to take 10 swings based on the length of your animal's string.**

1. Draw FBD for your flying animal
2. Write N2L Equations in `\(x\)` & `\(y\)` direction
3. Sub them into each other
4. Solve for `\(v^2\)` & sub in for `\(v\)` in terms and distance and period

Hints: You will need trig for forces. You can solve for the radius of the circle in terms of the length `\(L\)` of the "leash".]

#Test Corrections

1. Determine correct answer for questions answered incorrectly
    + For FRQ you need to correct the entire part (i.e. part (a)) if you lost *any* points
    + No you cannot see what you put before - start from scratch
2. For MC questions you must provide a justification for your answers
    + Tips:
        - Start with a fact of physics "slope of VT is acceleration" or "area of VT is displacement"
        - Draw a diagram to help (i.e. draw a VT graph)
        - Try to use a claim evidence reasoning format to write your justification
3. For FRQ's ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT IS ASKED!
4. Finally, compare your new, correct answers to your test and determine if your mistake was one of the 4 C's: clueless, careless, conceptual, or calculation.

# A ***force*** is an interaction between two objects.

---
#Interaction types

- **Gravitational Force** `\(\vec{F}_g\)` (Long Range) ‚û° Attractive force between all objects with mass

--
- **Normal Force**  `\(\vec{F}_N\)` (Contact, Compression) ‚û° "Perpendicular Force" occurs because atoms are compressed and want to return to original position. **Always perpendicular to surfaces in contact**

--
- **Spring Force** `\(\vec{F}_s\)` (Contact, Stretch or Compression) ‚û° Spring is stretched or compressed and wants to return to "natural" length

--
- **Tension** `\(\vec{F}_T\)` (Contact, Stretch) ‚û° Atomic Structure is stretched and wants to return to natural length

--
- **Friction** `\(\vec{F}_f\)` (Contact, Shear) ‚û° Irregular surfaces interlock to slow or prevent sliding of two surfaces relative to eachother **Always parallel to the surfaces in contact**

--
- **Drag** `\(\vec{F}_D\)` (Contact) ‚û° Fluid/gas Friction, resists objects motion through a fluid/gas

--
- **Bouyant Force** `\(\vec{F}_B\)` (Contact) ‚û° Fluid/Gas Normal Force

--
- **Electrostatic Force** `\(\vec{F}_e\)` (Long Range) - Attractice or resistive force because objects have charge

--
- **Magnetic Force** `\(\vec{F}_M\)` (Long Range) - Attractive or repulsive force because of moving charge

###Tug-of-War Simulation

[Simulation Link](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/forces-and-motion-basics/latest/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?screens=1) Note: check all 3 boxes in the top right

True/False: Determine whether each of the following statements are true. Support your claims with evidence and examples. (Remember that you can add/remove people while the cart is moving.)

1. A person's location on the rope matters.
2. Different combinations of people can produce the same sum of forces.
3. The sum of the forces on the cart is always equal to the addition of the individual forces.
4. It is impossible for the cart to accelerate to the left if there are people pulling it to the right.
5. The side with the bigger person will always win.
6. The side with more people will always win.
7. It is impossible to make the cart decrease in speed.
8. It is impossible to make the cart move at a steady speed.
9. The cart will always move in the direction of the sum of the forces.
10. If the sum of the forces is zero, the cart must be at rest.

##Tug-of-War Simulation Summary:

- Make an argument (claim-evidence-reasoning) for how forces/combinations of force lead to:
    + Constant Velocity
    + Acceleration

#Interaction Stations

##Contact Interactions

Interaction between two objects that results in **compression**, **tension** or **shearing**.

--


**Compression** ‚û° Squishing a material together

--

**Extension** ‚û° Stretching a material

--

**Shearing** ‚û° Pulling surfaces parallel to each other

##Linearizing


What do we do when our data is non-linear?

--

- We turn it into a line!

--
- How? By applying a mathematical operation to one of our variables and replotting our graph

##Test Your Model

### Test 1:

- Put two stools together and place a meter stick across them
- Predict where to drop your ball so it bounces up to the meter sticks
- Use your model -- not a data point that may happen to coincidentally match

--

### Test 2:

- In the MUF Perry will go up on the lift and drop your ball from the ceiling
- Take a video (does not need to be slow motion) so that you can get the entire drop and bounce in the video.
- Using tools in pivot compare the actual measured bounce height (from the video) to what your linear model predicted
- Put your results on your whiteboard

#Survival Island üèùÔ∏è

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island üòÆ!

--

Using *each* of your <u>unique skill's</u> develop a plan to escape the island.

--

Whiteboard your response (one person)
- remember to remain physically distant when possible

--

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.

#Polar Bears Around an Ice Hole

##How many do you see?

---

#Why? What connections to physics class?

---


#Why?

--

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (need to see more cards)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated
--

- constrain the variables (set number of groups with specific sizing)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat
