#Test it out

Make a building

Your building can look any way you want ‚Äì as long as it has three or more floors,
all different colors. And how do we store these colors? In an array, of course!
You can make each floor an ellipse, a rectangle, even a triangle.
But when it comes to using `fill()` to color each floor, remember -- you should be
getting the color value from your array.

Extensions:

1. How could you maybe use another array to make your code even easier to understand and more simple?
2. What other values are you changing for each floor?
3. Could you change the text used for colors to RGB values instead?
4. Is there a way to do that using one array instead of three?

---

class:schodack

###What does this do?

```javascript
var colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'white'];
var color1, color2;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  color1 = colors[floor(random(0, colors.length))];
	color2 = colors[floor(random(0, colors.length))];
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  rectMode(CENTER);
  fill(color1);
  rect(100,100,100,100);
  fill(color2);
  ellipse(300,250,100);
}

```

#`floor()`

- The `random()` function does one amazing thing - it gives us a number, randomly chosen. Thankfully, it‚Äôs controlled chaos. We can tell the random function that we want a number between, say, 3 and 7. Or 5.894858 and 9.483984.
- If I write var num = random(4, 9);, num will be equal to a number that is greater than or equal to four, and less than nine. The problem there is that that number could very well be 5.93943. If we want to be able to use this function to pick an element from an array, we need to make sure that the random() function is returning a whole number.

--

- `floor(5.9058588585)` will equal 5

Pick 10 fortune cookie messages from this list (Links to an external site.) (or create your own), store them in an array, and whenever the user loads the sketch, a different text message will be displayed. Remember the text("Your text here", x, y); function will display text. You can also put you array item in place of the quotes (like: text(listOfThings[1], x, y);)
Design your program to look like a fortune cookie slip.

Extensions:

- add a button that loads a different fortune when the user clicks it this could update the current fortune, OR
- add a second fortune slip below

#Loops

##How we tell the computer to repeat itself, but change one aspect each time.

--

Look at your code for the 5 circles. What was similar and what was different about each line?

--

How could we simplify this code?

---

class:inverse

#Loops

1. Start at 100
--

2. If we haven't reached the edge of the screen
--

  - Draw ellipse
--

  - Move 100px to the right


---

class:inverse

#The Code

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

class:inverse

#Three Steps For A While Loop

--

1. We declare and initialize a variable. Initializing a variable is setting the initial value for that variable, or where you want it to start. In this case, we would like to it begin at 100 pixels.

--
2. We check whether it meets a condition. The condition is inside the parentheses. We want to execute the code in the brackets on condition that x is still less than the width of the canvas.

--
3. We change the value of that variable in a way that will eventually make it meet the condition. In the code below, 100 is added to x inside the brackets. Every time the code is run x will increase by 100 until it's value is larger than the width of the canvas. Then the loop will be completed and the program will move on in the code.

---

class:inverse

#1. Initialize Variable

```javascript

*var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

class:inverse

#2. Check Condition

```javascript

var x = 100;
*while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

class:inverse

#Do the stuff

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
* ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---
class:inverse

#3. Iterate Variable

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
* x = x + 100;
}

```

- Draw a row of ellipses 50 pixels apart
- Draw ellipses only on the left half of the canvas

##Task 2:

##Extensions (if you have time)

- Repeating their emoji from unit 1
- Creating a grid of ellipses

---

class:inverse

##`for()` Loop

```javascript

for (var x = 100; x < width; x = x + 100){
  ellipse(x, 60, 40, 40);
}

```

##vs. `while()` Loop

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}
```

class: inverse

# `for()` vs. `while()`

.left-column[

##`for()`

- good for *finite* and specific number of steps
  - i.e. "phone locks after 5 attempts of password"
- can't do everything a `while()` loop can

]

.right-column[

##`while()`

- good for *infinite* number of steps (i.e. testing for correct passsword with unlimited attempts)
- can be used in place of any `for()` loop, but requires extra line of code

]

Congratulations! Your great aunt‚Äôs second cousin twice removed (on your mother‚Äôs side) has recently left you a spooky old house. This is great, because ‚Äúfree house‚Äù. As you can imagine, however, this does come with its fair share of problems, because spooky, and old.

The biggest problem your great aunt‚Äôs second cousin twice removed‚Äôs attorney warns you about when handing over the deed is that the wiring in the house is pretty old and nonsensical. Sometimes, a light switch controls multiple lights: it might turn more than one light on at a time, and will also turn some lights off. Because the house is spooky, you need to figure out how to turn all of the lights on as quickly as possible.

The attorney recommends you try to make this into a game to help you practice and to distract you from the dark foreboding shadows that definitely are not hiding anything you need to worry about (but let‚Äôs turn the lights on just in case?).

Create a p5 program that will have at least 6 buttons - your light switches. Each light switch should control several other lights, and maybe also the light you clicked. Create a solvable puzzle game in which you need to find the right order to press the switches so all lights are turned on at once.

**Requirements**: Work with a partner or alone to complete the following:
  1. Create a game with at least six clickable buttons.
  1. Create a flowchart of your game so you can guarantee that there is a combination of switches that you can click to turn them all on, solving the puzzle.
  1. Create a p5 program where each switch turns a combination of lights on and/or off.
  1. Add any necessary design elements to make this game look appealing!

####Writing Prompt:

Describe your design process, including stepping through the code to explain exactly how to reach a solution and why your solution works.


####Extensions:

- Figure out how to draw a new background and ‚Äúscene‚Äù if you win, so that the player knows they have completed the challenge.
- Figure out how to keep score, and make something happen if the user has clicked too many times without solving the puzzle.

#Conditionals

.center[<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_2/1.1/ifthen.png" width = "300px"/>]

???

If a button, mouse, or key is pressed, or if a mouse is moved, we want something to happen. The conditional statements that we write affect the computer's output. We are going to write a program that changes the color of a shape based on the position of the mouse but first let's discuss conditional logic or boolean expressions. The word boolean indicates that something is true or false.

---


#Conditionals

We want the computer to look at an **expression** and evaluate whether it is **true** or **false**, if it's true do one thing, and if it's false do another. Let's take a look at some expressions and evaluate them as true or false.

- 26>5 ‚Üí 26 is greater than 5. Let's read that as a question. Is 26 greater than 5? Yes it is. This expression evaluates to "true."
- 10=14 ‚Üí Since 10 is not equal to 14. This expression evaluates to "false"
- 4>210 ‚Üí This expression is also "false"
- 2=2 ‚Üí "true"

???

- **Using Variables in Conditional Statements**
    - The statements we have written so far are pretty pointless. 5 will always be less than 6 and 5 will never be less than 4, so there can only be one result from these statements. These are pretty fixed.
    - On the other hand, we've had already written expressions using values that are constantly changing. They were called variables, and while some of them don't change (like when we create variables for the size or static location of a shape), some of them are changing all the time.
    - `mouseX` and `mouseY` are two of the built-in variables that we used. The value of the mouse location changes whenever you move your mouse. If we wrote the boolean expression `mouseX>100` it can be true or false. If the mouse were anywhere between 0 and 100 pixels on the x-axis, this expression would evaluate to false. If the mouse were anywhere between 101 and the width of the canvas, the expression would evaluate to true.
    - Let's write a sketch that will turn the background black `if(mouseX>300)`. `300` is the center of our 600-pixel wide canvas so it will be easy to tell if our conditional is working. Based on our statement, if the value of `mouseX` is greater than `300`, the background should turn black. We are also going to set an initial color for the canvas (I set it to white.) That way when my conditional evaluates to false when `mouseX < 300`, the canvas will turn white again.
    - Show this code to your students or have them code along and use `console.log(mouseX)` so that students can see how the condition in the if statement is satisfied. Move the mouse back and forth a few times so that the background changes color when `mouseX` increases and decreases.

Change this example and try turning the canvas black when the Y position of your mouse is greater than 60, or another number. See what happens when you change the variable to mouseY.


---

#Changing a `fill()`

- We can use conditionals to change color, size, or any other values in our sketches. We're going to use the same conditional from the last example to change the fill of a square.
- If the X position of the mouse passes the center of the canvas, the fill of the rectangle will turn blue.
- It's important to remember to draw the rectangle after the conditional so that the fill() will be applied to the rect. See this example.

##Changing a Custom Variable with a Conditional

We can also change custom variables inside conditional statements. In this example, both the width and height of the rectangle are determined by a variable called x. That variable is changed inside the conditional statement.

#Make Your Own Interactive Sketch:

Use the mouse position to change a variable and create an interactive sketch.

## **Requirements:**

- Create more than two variations of this shape by writing a conditional statement using the x position and y position of your mouse.
- You can change the color, size or position of a shape. See this example.

# **Extensions**

- Create a condition that will change the fill of a rectangle if the mouse is hovering over the rectangle.
- Hint: You could use && (and) to combine conditions
- Adapt a previous sketch and add interactivity to it.

#Discussion: Else If

We can use "else if" to add more possible outcomes to our sketches. Since there are often more than two possible conditions that we want to work with, we can instruct the program to perform different tasks based on a range of conditions.
I might want to tell someone that if it's cold they should wear a coat, but I also may want to say:
- "if it's freezing, wear a coat,
- if it's cold, wear a jacket,
- otherwise just wear a sweater."

We can do this by adding "else if" to our conditionals between "if" and "else."

- The program will test each condition in order. As soon as one condition evaluates to true, the code inside those brackets is executed and the program continues after the statement.
--

- Code along: In the following sketch we test the location of the mouse, and at every 100 pixels, we draw an ellipse close to it. Notice how we begin with the highest value.

--

What does it mean to have 0 vs. 255?

???

- So far, fill has been used to accept only one number, and it's created greyscale drawings. In reality, fill accepts three values in a default color mode called RGB - or Red, Green, Blue.
- We can use these colors to change elements of our drawing, however, we need to be aware that they work differently than colors we may have used in art classes. If you run this project, you will see three circles in red, green, and blue that overlap and mix - yet this mixing is probably different than what you are used to.
- This is because computers use additive mixing, a process that adds different colored lights to create color. Traditional media uses subtractive mixing, which absorbs different colored lights to create color. (an in-depth explanation of the RGB color model can be found [here](http://dba.med.sc.edu/price/irf/Adobe_tg/models/rgbcmy.html) )

- `ellipse(170, 100, 100, 100);`
- `fill(0, 0, 255);`
- `ellipse(145, 150, 100, 100);`

##But wait! There is more!

`fill()` has a 4th argument - Opacity

.center[<iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/mrporterphysics/sketches/8lSbxz3w3" width = "1100 px" height = "450 px"></iframe>]

???

- In our mixing program, we have also adjusted the transparency (the optional fourth value in fill) to allow colors to mix. Its range is 0 (transparent: not visible) to 255 (opaque). You will notice that when we want to change fill, we call a new color before the shape we want to change. Because the draw function is a repeated loop, this presents one color from being applied to every shape.

#Custom Variables

- Creating a Variable:

--
  1. **Declare** Declaring our variable is basically just telling the program ‚Äúhey! I‚Äôm creating a variable, and this is what it‚Äôs going to be called.‚Äù All you need to do when you want to declare a variable is write the term " `var variableName`"

--
  2. **Initialize** - give variableName a value. This is called an assignment operation. We are assigning a value to our variable. If I write `variableName = 50`, every time I use my variable name, the program will replace it with the number 50.

--
  3. **Use the variable** - Your code won‚Äôt break if you don‚Äôt use the variable, but then what was the point? If we add an `ellipse at ellipse(100,100,variableName,variableName)`, our ellipse will be 50px wide and 50px high.

##`random()` vs. `rect()` and `ellipse()`

- We can also place our ellipse at a random position each time our program runs. To do this, we use p5's random function. This function is different from other functions we have been using (like `ellipse` and `rect`) in that it returns a value. Each time they are called:

--
  - `random(50, 100)` returns a number between 50 and 100

--
  - `random(1, 5)` returns a number between 1 and 5

--
- When the first parameter is omitted, random assumes it is 0:

--
  - `random(100)` returns a number between 0 and 100

--
  - `random(5)` returns a number between 0 and 5

---

class:inverse

##What do the following return?

##Number Types...

###Using `mouseX` and `mouseY`

Why was this code helpful? (What does it do?)

```
function draw() {
	background(100);
	text(mouseX + ", " + mouseY, 20, 20);
}

```

--

- The `mouseX` variable holds the value of the x-coordinate of the current mouse location.
- The `mouseY` variable holds the value of the y-coordinate of the current mouse location.
- The values of these two variables will update in real-time as you move your mouse over the canvas.

---

##What happens?

```
function setup(){
  createCanvas(400,400);
}

function draw(){
  background(mouseX);
  ellipse(width/2,height/2, mouseY);
}
```

---

#Interactivity

- These two simple system variables are what p5.js is all about - they easily allow us to make our projects **interactive** and fun for the user.
- **Interactivity** is the ability of a computer program to respond to the user‚Äôs **input**. The computer will **process** this input data to produce an **output**.

---

##Try It:

1. Make an ellipse follow your mouse
2. Make a rectangle follow your mouse

What is similar? What is different?

class:inverse

#`rectMode()`

`rectMode()` allows you to change the reference point for drawing rectangles to the center. You do that with `rectMode(CENTER);`


---
#üíª Paired Programming

With your partner (randomly assiged in breakout rooms)

- Use `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` to change the height or width of a rectangle
- Use `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` to change the height or width of an ellipse
- Use `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` to change the shade of the canvas
- Use `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` to change the fill of a rectangle or ellipse
- üîå Extension: Create a triangle that follows your mouse

**Save this file and <u>BOTH</u> of you will turn this file in!**

Note: You can comment out each task after you complete it so you can submit one file.

For example:

//ellipse(width/2, height/2, 50,50);

//ellipse 1/3 across the screen
ellipse(width/3, height/2, 50,50);
