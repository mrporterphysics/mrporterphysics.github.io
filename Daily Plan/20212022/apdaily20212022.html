#Spring Force

**Essential Question**: How does the elongation (stretch) of your spring relate to the amount of force applied to the spring?

1. Collect data from both springs (small spring and ceiling spring)
2. Use different masses and your knowledge about the weight of an object to determine the force on your spring

--

Board Meeting:
  - What was the mathematical relationship?
  - What does the slope represent? (the [y-variable] changes by [slope] [y units] for every 1 [x units] of [x variable])
  - What does the intercept represent? Is is negigible or non-negligible?

---

#Spring Force


##$$|\vec{F_s}| = k|\vec{x}|$$

---

#Test the model:

You want to use your spring as a mass measuring device. On a whiteboard...

1. Derive an expression the for the mass `\(m\)` of a unknown hanging mass in terms of the stretch `\(x\)` of your spring, the spring constant `\(k\)` and any known physical constants.
2. Hang something in the classroom of unknown mass on one of your springs, use the derivation to determine the mass of that object. (Note: use 9.8 for `\(g\)`)
3. Check your results using the electronic balance.

---

##Lets think about Friction...

.center[<img src="images/tractorBlock.png" width = "300 px"/>]

A tractor is trying to pull a very heavy block of concrete across a rough concrete floor, but is unable to move it. **Draw a free body diagram for the concrete block.** What is the direction of the friction (resistive) force alone exerted on the block?

--

The Tractor increases its tension force on the block. What happens to the magnitude of the frictional force on the block?
--
The tractor continues to increase its frictional force, what will eventually happen?

--

üß†‚õàÔ∏è What other factors could affect the frictional force?

---

##Lets think about Friction...

Boxes are held at rest against rough vertical walls by forces pushing horizontally on the boxes as shown.

.center[<img src="images/BlockWall.jpg" width = "400 px"/>]

1. Draw a freebody diagram and vector addition diagram for situation A.
--

2. Rank the weights of the boxes.
--

3. Rank the magnitude of the normal forces exerted on the boxes by the wall.
--

4. Rank the fricitonal forces on the boxes exerted by the walls
--

5. What conditions would need to be satisified for the boxes to slide down the wall?

---

#Friction Simulation Lab

**Essential Question**: *How does the normal force affect the static frictional force on an object on different surfaces?*


---


**.gray[2021.11.16] .blue[AP Physics] .red[Do Now]** .small[A student uses a string to pull a block across a table at a constant speed of 2 meters per second. The string makes an angle Œ∏ with the horizontal. A second student makes a free-body diagram of the block, and then uses this free-body diagram to generate a vector sum diagram as shown.]

.center[<img src="images\Fbddonow1.jpg" width ="300 px"/><img src="images\Fbddonow2.jpg" width ="500 px"/>]

.small[Three Students are comparing the magnitudes of the forces in the vector sum diagram. Determine **what is correct** in each statement.

**Anja**: *The vector sum diagram allows us to compare the magnitudes of all four forces: The weight is the largest, then the tension, then friction, then the normal force.*

**Barb**: *Well, the weight is definitely greater than the normal force. But there should be a net force to the right in the vector sum because that's the way the block is moving, and there isn't. I don't think we can use it to rank the other forces.*

**Cole**: *I think we can use it to say that the weight is greater than the normal force. Also, the tension is greater than the friction, since the friction is the same length as the dashed line, and this is equal to the tension times the cosine of theta (Œ∏). But we can't compare the vertical forces with the horizontal ones.*]

###Tug-of-War Simulation

[Simulation Link](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/forces-and-motion-basics/latest/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?screens=1) Note: check all 3 boxes in the top right

True/False: Determine whether each of the following statements are true. Support your claims with evidence and examples. (Remember that you can add/remove people while the cart is moving.)

1. A person's location on the rope matters.
2. Different combinations of people can produce the same sum of forces.
3. The sum of the forces on the cart is always equal to the addition of the individual forces.
4. It is impossible for the cart to accelerate to the left if there are people pulling it to the right.
5. The side with the bigger person will always win.
6. The side with more people will always win.
7. It is impossible to make the cart decrease in speed.
8. It is impossible to make the cart move at a steady speed.
9. The cart will always move in the direction of the sum of the forces.
10. If the sum of the forces is zero, the cart must be at rest.

##Tug-of-War Simulation Summary:

- Make an argument (claim-evidence-reasoning) for how forces/combinations of force lead to:
    + Constant Velocity
    + Acceleration

You are standing at the edge of a cliff preparing for some cliff jumping during the summer. You remember from physics class that you could determine the height
that you are jumping from by using some free fall kinematics. You remember you can determine the height based on the time it takes for something to fall dropped from rest.
You drop a rock and time how long it takes to fall into the water below.

1. Derive an experession for the height of the cliff `\(H\)` in terms of the time `\(t\)` it takes a rock to fall into the water
below and any other physical constants (i.e. `\(g\)`).
2. Assume you knew the height of the cliff and wanted to predict the time. Now derive an expression for `\(t\)` in terms of `\(H\)` and any physical constants.

##Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

####ABCD: Answer, Basic Physics, Cite information, Draw it together

--

**Answer the Question** (Claim)

- DO: State whether something increases, decreases, or stays the same.
  - If given two or more cases to choose from, state which case answers the question, or clearly state that both cases are the same.
- DON'T: Just say that something ‚Äúchanges‚Äù. We need to know how it changes. Talk about how it could be either case or both. You need to commit to an answer.

---

##Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

####ABCD: Answer, Basic Physics, Cite information, Draw it together

**Basic Physics** (Evidence)

- Your explanation needs to include at least one statement of basic physics. You'll know that this is a statement of basic physics because a statement of basic physics is true all the time, every day, and in all situations. Basic physics can be the name of a law of physics, like "Newton‚Äôs Third Law", or it can be a statement of the law itself, such as "when the horse pulls the cart, the cart pulls back on the horse with the same force."

---

##Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

####ABCD: Answer, Basic Physics, Cite information, Draw it together


**Cite Important Information** (Evidence)

- This is when you point out important aspects of this particular situation that are relevant to your explanation. The Cite Information sentence should start with the words ‚Äúin this situation‚Äù or ‚Äúin Case 1‚Äù or ‚Äúfor the small cart, ...‚Äù and proceed to say something about the particular problem you are presented with.

--

**Draw It All Together** (Reasoning)

- This is when you take your statements of basic physics and the important information that you cited from this situation and show how it logically leads to the correct answer. Depending on how well you do your B‚Äôs and C‚Äôs, your ‚ÄúDraw it Together‚Äù might only be a single sentence.

---

##More Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

- Do NOT use "it", "they", "them". Use good nouns (you know the words on your reference table)

--
- Use good verbs that talk about what the nouns are doing
  - (Objects will speed up, slow down, change direction, gain/lose/transfer energy, gain/lose/transfer momentum, exert or experience forces, etc.)

--
- You do not need to restate the question.

--
- Don't write more than you mean to

--
- Don't write just "force" - state the specific force

--
- Don't write "it moves"!!

###Displacement

- Change in position of an object
- `\(\Delta x = x_f - x_i\)`
- Includes direction

--

###Distance

- the **magnitude** (or size) of displacement between two positions
- more often referred to as ***distance traveled*** which is the total length of the path traveled between two positions

--

###Position
- Where an object is at any particular time
- "Location"

#Buggy Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
- What does the intercept mean?

#The Models...

#The Models...


Math: $$y = mx + b$$

--

Specific Model: $$position = (75\textrm{ cm/s})time + 23 \textrm{ cm}$$

--

Generic Model: $$x = \bar{v}t + x_0$$

--

Average Velocity:

$$\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

---

#Velocity

- is a ***vector*** quantity -- means it has two properties: size and direction
- Size: how great or little the rate of position changing with time
- Direction: the direction that the object is moving
- is the slope of a position vs. time graph

---

#Speed vs. Velocity

- **Speed** is a scalar quantity

#Make Predictions!

---

#Predicting with Models

Predict your buggy's positions after 3 seconds.

--

- Why isn't your predicted position exactly the same as the measured position? If you think you might have made measurement mistakes, what specifically were they, and how would those mistakes affect the model?
--

- Does having a non-zero percent different mean the model was wrong? Is the model still useful, even if its predictions are off a little bit? Explain.
--

- Why might you need a better model of motion? Think of a "real world" example where it would be important to have a more accurate model of a moving object. (When does this model for motion become limited?)

#Lab Grouping

Arrange yourself into ***logical*** lab groups based on the word on your card.


**Rules:**

The class must have

- 5 Groups
- 4 Groups of 3 People
- 1 Group of 4 People

---

#Why? What connections to physics class?

#Why?

--

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (need to see more cards)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated
--

- constrain the variables (set number of groups with specific sizing)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat

---

#Survival Island üèùÔ∏è

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island üòÆ!

--

Using *each* of your <u>unique skill's</u> develop a plan to escape the island.

--

Whiteboard your response (one person)
- remember to remain physically distant when possible

--

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
