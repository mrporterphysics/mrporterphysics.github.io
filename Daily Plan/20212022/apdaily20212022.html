- Change in position of an object
- `\(\Delta x = x_f - x_i\)`
- Includes direction

--

###Distance

- the **magnitude** (or size) of displacement between two positions
- more often referred to as ***distance traveled*** which is the total length of the path traveled between two positions

#Buggy Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
- What does the intercept mean?

---

#The Models...

---

#The Models...


Math: $$y = mx + b$$

--

Specific Model: $$position = (75\textrm{ cm/s})time + 23 \textrm{ cm}$$

--

Generic Model: $$x = \bar{v}t + x_0$$

--

Average Velocity:

$$\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

---

#Velocity

- is a ***vector*** quantity -- means it has two properties: size and direction
- Size: how great or little the rate of position changing with time
- Direction: the direction that the object is moving
- is the slope of a position vs. time graph

---

#Speed vs. Velocity

- **Speed** is a scalar quantity

#Make Predictions!

---

#Predicting with Models

Predict your buggy's positions after 3 seconds.

--

- Why isn't your predicted position exactly the same as the measured position? If you think you might have made measurement mistakes, what specifically were they, and how would those mistakes affect the model?
--

- Does having a non-zero percent different mean the model was wrong? Is the model still useful, even if its predictions are off a little bit? Explain.
--

- Why might you need a better model of motion? Think of a "real world" example where it would be important to have a more accurate model of a moving object. (When does this model for motion become limited?)

#Why?

--

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (need to see more cards)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated
--

- constrain the variables (set number of groups with specific sizing)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat

---

#Survival Island üèùÔ∏è
