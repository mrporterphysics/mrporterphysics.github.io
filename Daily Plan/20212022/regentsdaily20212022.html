1. Test your car:
  - How fast does is it moving the **instant before** it hits the block
  - Does your car's speed change with mass?
  - Can you make any adjustments to make your car faster?
2. Design Slides:
  1. Purpose
  2. Materials
  3. Methods - Describe your building process. Summarize the problems you encountered during the building process and how you solved them.
  4. Photograph/diagram: Label any design features
  5. Data (to be completed on day of crash or later)
  6. Calculations (to be completed on day of crash or later)

1. Determine
  - How fast your car is moving the instant **before** your car hits the block
  - If your car's speed changes with car mass
  - Can you make adjustments to your car so that is goes faster?

Note:

- Be sure to record somewhere how you are measuring/calculating the speed of your car at the bottom of the ramp

Coming Up:

- Thursday: What is momentum? What is impulse?

##2021.05.18 Regents Physics (TF)

1. Paper Car Crash Project
2. Building/Designing your Car 1.0

---
class: schodack

##Key Question

- Is it possible to build a car frame and body from paper and glue that is strong enough to protect a raw egg during a head-on collision?
-  What engineering and design features determine a vehicle’s crashworthiness?

---
class: schodack

## Purpose
The object of the Paper Car Crash Contest is to apply your science and engineering knowledge and skills to design and build the most crashworthy car that includes a minimum of three safety design features. The winning car’s crashworthiness will be based on two criteria:

1. The car with the greatest momentum at the time of collision, and,
2. A car in which the occupant (raw egg) is neither injured (cracked shell) nor killed (broken shell) as a result of the collision.

---
class: schodack

## Design Product/Presentation

Your challenge is to design and build a car with the greatest momentum (i.e., fast
and massive) using only two sheets of copy paper and unlimited amounts of glue
for the car’s frame and body. Your paper car must be able to carry a raw egg down
an inclined track ramp and protect it during a crash with a concrete block. Your
teacher will provide the wheels, axles, and axle housing for construction of your car.
Read the Rules & Specifications listed below before beginning your design process
and remember that in order to win, you must have BOTH a car with the greatest
momentum AND an egg occupant that survives the crash unharmed. On the day before the car crash contest, you must introduce your design to the class and identify ***at least 3 safety
design features*** you incorporated into your car’s design.

---
class: schodack

##Rules & Specifications

1. Maximum car width: less than equal to 7.5 centimeters (including axles and wheels)
2. Maximum car length: less than or equal to 16.5 centimeters
3. Minimum car mass without the egg: greater than or equal to 40 grams
4. Glue, paper, wheels, axles, and the straw-axle housing are the only construction materials allowed. The entire
frame of the car must be made of paper and glue.
5. Your vehicle will be disqualified if it exceeds length and width dimensions, does not meet minimum mass
requirements, or contains stickers, paint, tape, cardboard or any other non-licensed materials that contribute to
the structural integrity of the vehicle.
6. Vehicle designs must allow for easy access to and removal of the egg (occupant) for inspection after the crash.
7. Vehicle designs should be able to withstand 2-3 trials/collisions without parts replacement or repairs.
8. There can be no physical contact between the vehicle and the designer once the vehicle has been released onto
the track.
9. All vehicles must visibly display the following information on their frames:
  - vehicle name
  - builder’s name
  - vehicle length in centimeters
  - vehicle mass in grams

####Write yourself some notes describing the problem-solving process for this

---

##🔌 Extensions

####In your notebook answer the following questions
--

-  You (hypothetically) repeat this experiment on a a steeper ramp. Will your `\(\Delta x_2\)`
increase, decrease, or remain the same to keep the same `\(\Delta t \)`? Justify your answer by citing our derived equation.
--

-  A peer in you class claims that shortening the distance between the two photogates by moving photogate 1 down
the ramp towards photogate 2 (while keeping photogate two stationary) will decrease the time that it takes to
move through the photogates. Justify this with **two** reasons from our derivation.

#Predicting with Models

- Why isn't your predicted time exactly the same as the actual time? If you think you might have made measurement mistakes, what specifically were they, and how would those mistakes affect the model?
--

- Does having a non-zero percent different mean the model was wrong? Is the model still useful, even if its predictions are off a little bit? Explain.
--

- Why might you need a better model of the ball than what you came up with? Think of a "real world" example where it would be important to have a more accurate model of a moving object. (When does this model for motion become limited?)

---

class:schodack

#Ball Rolling Left

Like in Level 1, you will be plotting position vs. time for the bowling ball and generating an equation for the motion. How will the graph and equation be similar to those you found in Level 1? How will they be different? What do you see in the video that makes you think that? Explain.

The game is in the name of the game - polar bears around an ice hole - invented in the days of Ghengis Khan.

A clue for you to keep you true -- like petals around a rose, you can count each bear's nose.

How many polar bears do you see?

class: schodack, center, middle

#Why? What connections to physics class?

---

class:schodack

#Why?

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That’s okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the “rules of the game.”
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don’t understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn’t always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the “answer”, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we’re all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the “answer” at most gives you one answer that you didn’t know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

---

class:schodack

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (many roles of the dice)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated (roll fewer dice)
--

- constrain the variables (set dice to specific values)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat

---

#Survival Island 🏝️

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island 😮!

--

Using *each* of your <u>unique skill's</u> develop a plan to escape the island.

--

Whiteboard your response (one person)
- please wash your hands, or use hand sanitizer before and after using the markers
- also remain at your tables physically distant from your group members.

--

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
