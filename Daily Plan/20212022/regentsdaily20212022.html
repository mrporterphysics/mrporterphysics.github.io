- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.
