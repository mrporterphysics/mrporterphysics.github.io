**Essential Question**: How does the elongation (stretch) of your spring relate to the amount of force applied to the spring?

1. Collect data from both springs (small spring and ceiling spring)
2. Use different masses and your knowledge about the weight of an object to determine the force on your spring

  - What does the slope represent? (the [y-variable] changes by [slope] [y units] for every 1 [x units] of [x variable])
  - What does the intercept represent? Is is negigible or non-negligible?

---

#Spring Force


##$$|\vec{F_s}| = k|\vec{x}|$$

---

#Test the model:

You want to use your spring as a mass measuring device. On a whiteboard...

1. Derive an expression the for the mass `\(m\)` of a unknown hanging mass in terms of the stretch `\(x\)` of your spring, the spring constant `\(k\)` and any known physical constants.
2. Hang something in the classroom of unknown mass on one of your springs, use the derivation to determine the mass of that object. (Note: use 9.8 for `\(g\)`)
3. Check your results using the electronic balance.

###Tug-of-War Simulation

[Simulation Link](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/forces-and-motion-basics/latest/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?screens=1) Note: check all 3 boxes in the top right

True/False: Determine whether each of the following statements are true. Support your claims with evidence and examples. (Remember that you can add/remove people while the cart is moving.)

1. A person's location on the rope matters.
2. Different combinations of people can produce the same sum of forces.
3. The sum of the forces on the cart is always equal to the addition of the individual forces.
4. It is impossible for the cart to accelerate to the left if there are people pulling it to the right.
5. The side with the bigger person will always win.
6. The side with more people will always win.
7. It is impossible to make the cart decrease in speed.
8. It is impossible to make the cart move at a steady speed.
9. The cart will always move in the direction of the sum of the forces.
10. If the sum of the forces is zero, the cart must be at rest.


---

##Tug-of-War Simulation Summary:

- Make an argument (claim-evidence-reasoning) for how forces/combinations of force lead to:
    + Constant Velocity
    + Acceleration

#Interaction Stations

##Contact Interactions

Interaction between two objects that results in **compression**, **tension** or **shearing**.

--


**Compression** ‚û° Squishing a material together

--

**Extension** ‚û° Stretching a material

--

**Shearing** ‚û° Pulling surfaces parallel to each other

---

class:center, middle

# A ***force*** is an interaction between two objects.

---
#Interaction types

- **Gravitational Force** `\(\vec{F}_g\)` (Long Range) ‚û° Attractive force between all objects with mass

--
- **Normal Force**  `\(\vec{F}_N\)` (Contact, Compression) ‚û° "Perpendicular Force" occurs because atoms are compressed and want to return to original position. **Always perpendicular to surfaces in contact**

--
- **Spring Force** `\(\vec{F}_s\)` (Contact, Stretch or Compression) ‚û° Spring is stretched or compressed and wants to return to "natural" length

--
- **Tension** `\(\vec{F}_T\)` (Contact, Stretch) ‚û° Atomic Structure is stretched and wants to return to natural length

--
- **Friction** `\(\vec{F}_f\)` (Contact, Shear) ‚û° Irregular surfaces interlock to slow or prevent sliding of two surfaces relative to eachother **Always parallel to the surfaces in contact**

--
- **Drag** `\(\vec{F}_D\)` (Contact) ‚û° Fluid/gas Friction, resists objects motion through a fluid/gas

--
- **Bouyant Force** `\(\vec{F}_B\)` (Contact) ‚û° Fluid/Gas Normal Force

--
- Electrostatic Force `\(\vec{F}_e\)` (Long Range) - Attractice or resistive force because objects have charge

--
- Magnetic Force `\(\vec{F}_M\)` (Long Range) - Attractive or repulsive force because of moving charge

1. An astronaut drops a hammer from 2.0 meters above the surface of the Moon. If the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is 1.62 meters
per second`\(^2\)`, how long will it take for the hammer to fall to the Moon‚Äôs surface?
2. A car traveling at a speed of 13 meters per second accelerates uniformly to a speed of 25 meters per second in 5.0 seconds. Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration of
the car during this 5.0-second time interval.
3. The driver of a car moving with a velocity of 15 meters per second made an emergency stop on a straight horizontal road. The wheels locked and the car skidded to a stop.
The marks made by the rubber tires on the dry asphalt are 16 meters long, and the car‚Äôs mass is 1200 kilograms. What is the car's acceleration while skidding to a stop?

##How Far?

**This is a hypothetical** (because obviously none of you text and drive, or will text and drive)

You are driving down Maple Hill Road when you get a text from your friend. You pick up your phone, read the text, and answer with "LOL". When you put your phone down, you see an object in the road and slam on the brakes to stop.

**How far do you travel during these events?**

On a whiteboard present your solution. You should include:

- Assumptions
- Diagrams
- Calculations

and your solution should be clear

#Question of the Day:

#.blue[Sweet or savory for breakfast?]

---

#Lab Grouping

Arrange yourself into ***logical*** lab groups based on the word on your card.


**Rules:**

The class must have

- 4 Groups of 3 People

---

class: center, middle

#Why? What connections to physics class?

---


#Why?

--

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (need to see more cards)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated
--

- constrain the variables (set number of groups with specific sizing)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat

---

#Survival Island üèùÔ∏è

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island üòÆ!

--

Using *each* of your <u>unique skill's</u> develop a plan to escape the island.

--

Whiteboard your response (one person)
- remember to remain physically distant when possible

--

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
