#2020.10.01 AP Physics

**Do Now**

‚úîÔ∏è Finish checking Carts + Ramps with card sort graphs

‚úîÔ∏è Fill out the chart at the end of the

‚úîÔ∏è Put your assigned problem on a vertical whiteboard with your partner (predicted vs. actual graphs and answers to the chart)

.qotd[QotD: ]

---

class:schodack

#2020.10.01

1. Do Now (finish lab)
2. Board Meeting - Carts + Ramps
3. Board Meeting - Dry Ice Pivot
4. Motion Definitions + Notes

---

class: schodack

# Carts + Ramps

1. Describe the position vs. time graph slope and how it compares to the velocity values
2. Describe your velocity vs. time graph's slope and how it compares to the position vs. time graph
3. For the groups that collected the "acceleration" data...how does the acceleration compare to the other two graphs? How are the related?

---

class:schodack

#Acceleration

- Acceleration tells how much an object‚Äôs speed changes in one second.
- When an object speeds up, its acceleration is in the direction of motion.
- When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite the direction of motion.

---

class: schodack

#Dry Ice Puck - Determining Acceleration Experimentally

1. Whiteboard your results -- sketch each of the 3 graphs you made
  - Position vs. Time
  - Linearized Position graph
  - Velocity vs. Time Graph
2. Provide the mathematical model that goes with each graph (equation)
3. Be prepared (i.e. discuss with someone near you) to discuss:
  - Meaning of slope for linear graphs
  - Meaning of intercept for linear graphs

---

class: schodack

#Defintions + Notes

- Displacement indicates how far an object ends up from its initial position, regardless of its total distance traveled.
--

- Average velocity is displacement divided by the time interval over which that displacement occurred.
--

- Instantaneous velocity is how fast an object is moving at a specific moment in time.

---

class: schodack

#Definitions + Notes

<br>

## **Position-time graphs**

- To determine how far from the detector an object is located, look at the vertical axis of the position-time graph.
--

- To determine how fast an object is moving, look at the steepness (i.e. the slope) of the position-time graph.
--

- To determine which way the object is moving, look at which way the position-time graph is sloped.
--

- A position-time slope like a front slash / means the object is moving away from the detector.
--

- A position-time slope like a back slash \ means the object is moving toward the detector
--

- Instantaneous velocity is found by taking the slope of the tangent line to a position-time graph



---

class: schodack

#Definitions + Notes

<br>

## **Velocity-time graphs**

- To determine how fast an object is moving, look at the vertical axis of the velocity-time graph.
--

- To determine which way the object is moving, look at whether the velocity-time graph is above or below the horizontal axis.
--

- An object is moving away from the detector if the velocity-time graph is above the horizontal axis.
--

- An object is moving toward the detector if the velocity-time graph is below the horizontal axis.
--

- To determine how far an object travels, determine the area between the velocity-time graph and the horizontal axis.
--

- On a velocity-time graph it is not possible to determine how far from the detector the object is located.
--

- Most everyday motion can be represented with straight segments on a velocity-time graph.

#Ball Rolling Right

1. Open Assignment
2. Read through your answers to Part 3 + 4
3. Be prepared to discuss and ask questions!

---

class: schodack

#Ball Rolling Right

- What do  you notice is similar about all of the graphs?
- What do you notice is different about the graphs?
- What conclusions can we make about the motion of the bowling ball from our graphical models of motion?

---

class:schodack

#Ball Rolling Right

- What does it all mean?
--

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
--

- What does the intercept mean?

---

class:schodack, center, middle

#The Models...

class:schodack

#The Models...

Math: $$y = mx + b$$

--

Specific Model: $$position = (75\textrm{ cm/s})time + 23 \textrm{ cm}$$

--

Generic Model: $$x = \bar{v}t + x_0$$

--

Average Velocity:

$$\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

---

class:schodack, center, middle

#What can we do with a model?

---

class:schodack, center, middle

#Make Predictions!

---

#Predicting with Models

- Why isn't your predicted time exactly the same as the actual time? If you think you might have made measurement mistakes, what specifically were they, and how would those mistakes affect the model?
--

- Does having a non-zero percent different mean the model was wrong? Is the model still useful, even if its predictions are off a little bit? Explain.
--

- Why might you need a better model of the ball than what you came up with? Think of a "real world" example where it would be important to have a more accurate model of a moving object. (When does this model for motion become limited?)

---

class:schodack

#Ball Rolling Left

Like in Level 1, you will be plotting position vs. time for the bowling ball and generating an equation for the motion. How will the graph and equation be similar to those you found in Level 1? How will they be different? What do you see in the video that makes you think that? Explain.

---

class:schodack

#Ball Rolling Left

Notes:

- Use same video trial as last time
- It was too quiet in here last time...talk to your neighbors when you have questions!

---

class:schodack

#Ball Rolling Left

- How do the slope and intercept vary here?

---

class:schodack

#Velocity

- is a ***vector*** quantity -- means it has two properties: size and direction
- Size: how great or little the rate of position changing with time
- Direction: the direction that the object is moving

---

class:schodack

#Ball Rolling Left - Ava's Hypothesis:

<br>

##Scientific Argument with Claim-Evidence-Reasoning format in physics:

**Claim:** Answer to the question

--

**Evidence:** Features of the graph or measurements that support your claim

--

**Reasoning:** Explain how the evidence supports your claim

background-image: url("https://media.giphy.com/media/Jrpy4EB3uqVx8RpRKK/giphy.gif")

The game is in the name of the game - polar bears around an ice hole - invented in the days of Ghengis Khan.

A clue for you to keep you true -- like petals around a rose, you can count each bear's nose.

How many polar bears do you see?

class: schodack, center, middle

#Why? What connections to physics class?

---

class:schodack

#Why?

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

---

class:schodack

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (many roles of the dice)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated (roll fewer dice)
--

- constrain the variables (set dice to specific values)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat

---

#Survival Island üèùÔ∏è

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island üòÆ!

--

Using *each* of your <u>unique skill's</u> develop a plan to escape the island.

--

Whiteboard your response (one person)
- please wash your hands, or use hand sanitizer before and after using the markers
- also remain at your tables physically distant from your group members.

--

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
