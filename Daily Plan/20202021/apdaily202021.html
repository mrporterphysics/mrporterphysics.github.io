In both cases below, a moving 50 N box has a force of 40 N that makes an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal. The coefficient of static friction between the box and the rough surface
is 0.6 and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.4

Will the frictional force exerted on the box by the rough surface in Case A be greater than, less than, or equal to the frictional force on the box by the rough surface in Case B?

#Breakout Rooms and "Whiteboarding"

In your breakout rooms...

- Compare your lab results (screen share or describe your graph)
- Come to a consensus on the relationship between Normal force and friction
- Discuss the meaning on the slope of the graph (if it isn't linear, linearize)
- Discuss the meaning of the intercept (or if it is negligible)
- Add a summary of your results the the shared Jamboard
- Elect a speaker for your slide

---

#Friction

--

.center[$$F_f \leq \mu F_N$$]

--

- Why `\(\leq\)`?
--

- Static - stationary (keeps object motionless)
--

- Kinetic - if the object is sliding (equation turns into equal)

--

Common Coefficients of Friction:

##Kinetic Friction Lab

- Record video of object sliding on a level surface
- üìπ Camera should be perpendicular to the motion
- Include something of known size in the video for scaling puproses
- Easiest way to upload to Pivot is directly from your phone (sign into Pivot on your browswer and upload from your camera roll)

--

ü•Ö Is to determine the coefficient of kinetic friction between your object and the surface it slides against

#Predicting with Models

- Why isn't your predicted time exactly the same as the actual time? If you think you might have made measurement mistakes, what specifically were they, and how would those mistakes affect the model?
--

- Does having a non-zero percent different mean the model was wrong? Is the model still useful, even if its predictions are off a little bit? Explain.
--

- Why might you need a better model of the ball than what you came up with? Think of a "real world" example where it would be important to have a more accurate model of a moving object. (When does this model for motion become limited?)

The game is in the name of the game - polar bears around an ice hole - invented in the days of Ghengis Khan.

A clue for you to keep you true -- like petals around a rose, you can count each bear's nose.

How many polar bears do you see?

class: schodack, center, middle

#Why? What connections to physics class?

---

class:schodack

#Why?

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

---

class:schodack

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (many roles of the dice)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated (roll fewer dice)
--

- constrain the variables (set dice to specific values)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat
