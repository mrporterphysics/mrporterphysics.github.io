#üí• Silly Putty and Bowling Ball Demo

Sketch a quick energy bar graph of the situation.

---

#Collisions

In collisions *something* is conserved, we need to figure out what that quantity is.

--

We will explore 4 different situations:

1. Bouncy Collision, Equal Masses
2. Bouncy Collision Unequal Masses
3. Sticky Collision, Equal Masses
4. Sticky Collision, Unequal Masses

---

#Collisions

We will look at these collisions one at a time and update our model.

--

What are we trying to find?

--

**A physical quantity that is conserved before and after a collision**

--

For each situation you will

1. Hypothesize what the conserved quantity is after **qualitative** observations
--

2. Test the situation to see if that quantity is conserved by collecting data on your carts
--

3. Continue to test until you find a conserved quantity, and then test to make sure it is **always** conserved before and after the collision
--

4. Compare with the rest of the class
--

5. Try the next situation with your findings from the previous and repeat the process

In both cases below, a moving 50 N box has a force of 40 N that makes an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal. The coefficient of static friction between the box and the rough surface
is 0.6 and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.4

.center[<img src="images/Frictiontiper.jpg" width = "700 px"/>]

Will the frictional force exerted on the box by the rough surface in Case A be greater than, less than, or equal to the frictional force on the box by the rough surface in Case B?

- Compare your lab results (screen share or describe your graph)
- Come to a consensus on the relationship between Normal force and friction
- Discuss the meaning on the slope of the graph (if it isn't linear, linearize)
- Discuss the meaning of the intercept (or if it is negligible)

#Friction

--

.center[$$F_f \leq \mu F_N$$]

- Why `\(\leq\)`?
--

- Static - stationary (keeps object motionless)
--

- Kinetic - if the object is sliding (equation turns into equal)

  - Position vs. Time
  - Linearized Position graph
  - Velocity vs. Time Graph
2. Provide the mathematical model that goes with each graph (equation)
3. Be prepared (i.e. discuss with someone near you) to discuss:
  - Meaning of slope for linear graphs
  - Meaning of intercept for linear graphs

#Ball Rolling Right

1. Open Assignment
2. Read through your answers to Part 3 + 4
3. Be prepared to discuss and ask questions!

---

class: schodack

#Ball Rolling Right

- What do  you notice is similar about all of the graphs?
- What do you notice is different about the graphs?
- What conclusions can we make about the motion of the bowling ball from our graphical models of motion?

---

class:schodack

#Ball Rolling Right

- What does it all mean?
--

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
--

- What does the intercept mean?

#The Models...

Math: $$y = mx + b$$

--

Specific Model: $$position = (75\textrm{ cm/s})time + 23 \textrm{ cm}$$

--

Generic Model: $$x = \bar{v}t + x_0$$

--

Average Velocity:

$$\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

#What can we do with a model?

class:schodack, center, middle

#Make Predictions!

---

#Predicting with Models

- Why isn't your predicted time exactly the same as the actual time? If you think you might have made measurement mistakes, what specifically were they, and how would those mistakes affect the model?
--

- Does having a non-zero percent different mean the model was wrong? Is the model still useful, even if its predictions are off a little bit? Explain.
--

- Why might you need a better model of the ball than what you came up with? Think of a "real world" example where it would be important to have a more accurate model of a moving object. (When does this model for motion become limited?)

---

class:schodack

#Ball Rolling Left

Like in Level 1, you will be plotting position vs. time for the bowling ball and generating an equation for the motion. How will the graph and equation be similar to those you found in Level 1? How will they be different? What do you see in the video that makes you think that? Explain.

#Ball Rolling Left

Notes:

- It was too quiet in here last time...talk to your neighbors when you have questions!

---

class:schodack

#Ball Rolling Left

- How do the slope and intercept vary here?

---

class:schodack

#Velocity

- is a ***vector*** quantity -- means it has two properties: size and direction
- Size: how great or little the rate of position changing with time
- Direction: the direction that the object is moving

The game is in the name of the game - polar bears around an ice hole - invented in the days of Ghengis Khan.

A clue for you to keep you true -- like petals around a rose, you can count each bear's nose.

How many polar bears do you see?

#Why? What connections to physics class?

---

class:schodack

#Why?

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

---

class:schodack

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (many roles of the dice)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated (roll fewer dice)
--

- constrain the variables (set dice to specific values)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat

---

#Survival Island üèùÔ∏è

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island üòÆ!

--

Using *each* of your <u>unique skill's</u> develop a plan to escape the island.

--

Whiteboard your response (one person)
- please wash your hands, or use hand sanitizer before and after using the markers
- also remain at your tables physically distant from your group members.

--

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
