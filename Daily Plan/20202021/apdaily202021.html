####In your notebook answer the following questions
--

-  You (hypothetically) repeat this experiment on a a steeper ramp. Will your `\(\Delta x_2\)`
increase, decrease, or remain the same to keep the same `\(\Delta t \)`? Justify your answer by citing our derived equation.
--

-  A peer in you class claims that shortening the distance between the two photogates by moving photogate 1 down
the ramp towards photogate 2 (while keeping photogate two stationary) will decrease the time that it takes to
move through the photogates. Justify this with **two** reasons from our derivation.

- Why isn't your predicted time exactly the same as the actual time? If you think you might have made measurement mistakes, what specifically were they, and how would those mistakes affect the model?
--

- Does having a non-zero percent different mean the model was wrong? Is the model still useful, even if its predictions are off a little bit? Explain.
--

- Why might you need a better model of the ball than what you came up with? Think of a "real world" example where it would be important to have a more accurate model of a moving object. (When does this model for motion become limited?)

#Ball Rolling Left

Like in Level 1, you will be plotting position vs. time for the bowling ball and generating an equation for the motion. How will the graph and equation be similar to those you found in Level 1? How will they be different? What do you see in the video that makes you think that? Explain.

#Ball Rolling Left

Notes:

- Use same video trial as last time
- It was too quiet in here last time...talk to your neighbors when you have questions!

#Ball Rolling Left

- How do the slope and intercept vary here?

#Velocity

- is a ***vector*** quantity -- means it has two properties: size and direction
- Size: how great or little the rate of position changing with time
- Direction: the direction that the object is moving

#Ball Rolling Left - Ava's Hypothesis:

##Scientific Argument with Claim-Evidence-Reasoning format in physics:

**Claim:** Answer to the question

--

**Evidence:** Features of the graph or measurements that support your claim

--

**Reasoning:** Explain how the evidence supports your claim

The game is in the name of the game - polar bears around an ice hole - invented in the days of Ghengis Khan.

A clue for you to keep you true -- like petals around a rose, you can count each bear's nose.

How many polar bears do you see?

#Why? What connections to physics class?

---

class:schodack

#Why?

- You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay.
--

- Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
--

- But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
--

- However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
--

- When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
--

- The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
--

- Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

---

class:schodack

#Inquiry

- make careful observations
--

- gather lots of data (many roles of the dice)
--

- look for patterns, compare and contrast, look for extremes
--

- simply the problem being investigated (roll fewer dice)
--

- constrain the variables (set dice to specific values)
--

- propose a hypothesis, test it, modify it based on results, repeat

---

#Survival Island üèùÔ∏è

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island üòÆ!

--

Using *each* of your <u>unique skill's</u> develop a plan to escape the island.

--

Whiteboard your response (one person)
- please wash your hands, or use hand sanitizer before and after using the markers
- also remain at your tables physically distant from your group members.

--

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.

#Learning happens in two phases: information transfer and sense-making

.left-column[ ##Information Transfer

???
Note back to the polar bears around an ice hole:

- I was providing information (how many polar bears)
- You were doing the sense-making (but I helped when I took dice away or offered hints)

class: schodack

#Who/what is helping with information transfer?

- [AP Daily Videos]("https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/92/home")
- [Flipping Physics]("https://www.flippingphysics.com/ap-physics-1.html")
- [Khan Academy Videos]("https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-1")
- [OpenStax College Physics]("https://openstax.org/books/college-physics-ap-courses/pages/1-connection-for-ap-r-courses")

#Who is helping with sense-making?



.left-column[.center[<img src="icons/thinking-svgrepo-com.svg" width = "100 px"/>]

##What does that look like?

- Coach and cheerleader
- Design and implement sense-making tasks and activities
- Offer feedback and encouragement
- Answer questions
- Clarify information received
- Give and grade assessments to provide *more* feedback]

#What is your role?

<br>

.left-column[.center[<img src="icons/notebook-bookmark-svgrepo-com.svg" width = "100 px"/>]
- Read and take notes over assigned readings
- Watch and take notes over assigned videos
- Interrogate what you‚Äôre reading or watching: ‚ÄúWhy is this true?‚Äù
- Understand that just because you‚Äôve been exposed to the information that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve learned it yet

]

.right-column[.center[<img src="icons/thinking-svgrepo-com.svg" width = "100 px"/>]

- Participate in class activities and relate them to the information from information transfer tasks
- Ask lots of questions
- Seek out feedback from peers and teacher
- Ask lots of questions
- Engage with homework meaningfully (don‚Äôt just Google for answers)
- Ask lots of questions
- Become comfortable with mistakes and being wrong at first
