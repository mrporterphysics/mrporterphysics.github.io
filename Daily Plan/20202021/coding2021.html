##2021.04.16 Coding

1. Do Now:
  - What is the difference between `setup()` and `draw()`?
  - Discuss with your partner in your breakout room for 2 minutes
2. Drawing with the mouse
3. Make your own
4. Share and compare

---

class:inverse

##Make your own

####‚åö 15 Minutes

- Make your program unique - you can draw with a line, a shape, a design. You can adjust the fill and transparency, and even try to calculate values to change how your program looks. Make the most UNIQUE program possible, as we will be looking at each other‚Äôs code!
  - Be Creative! This is a great opportunity to experiment. You can use `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` for different values and test the output. Play with the `dist()` function and experiment with color and shapes.
- Encourage them to do the following:
- Draw with different shapes.
- Change the fill or stroke based on your mouse position
- Change the size based on your mouse position.
- Use the `dist()` function to vary your tool based on how fast your mouse is moving

**Extensions**
- Make the drawing tool different depending on where on the canvas you're drawing
  - Split the canvas into four.
  - The drawing app should be different in each quadrant.

There are **two** things wrong with the following code. Find them and offer the fixes:

```

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}
// Debug challenge
// Find the bugs
// Why does the rectangle not change fill?
function draw() {
  background(220);
  fill(255, 0, 255); // inital fill purple

  rect(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);

  if (mouseY < width/2){
  // If mouseY is less then 200

    fill(0);// change fill to black
}

```

#Discussion: Else If

We can use "else if" to add more possible outcomes to our sketches. Since there are often more than two possible conditions that we want to work with, we can instruct the program to perform different tasks based on a range of conditions.
I might want to tell someone that if it's cold they should wear a coat, but I also may want to say:
- "if it's freezing, wear a coat,
- if it's cold, wear a jacket,
- otherwise just wear a sweater."

We can do this by adding "else if" to our conditionals between "if" and "else."

- The program will test each condition in order. As soon as one condition evaluates to true, the code inside those brackets is executed and the program continues after the statement.

- Code along: In the following sketch we test the location of the mouse, and at every 100 pixels, we draw an ellipse close to it. Notice how we begin with the highest value.

#Conditionals

.center[<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_2/1.1/ifthen.png" width = "300px"/>]

???

If a button, mouse, or key is pressed, or if a mouse is moved, we want something to happen. The conditional statements that we write affect the computer's output. We are going to write a program that changes the color of a shape based on the position of the mouse but first let's discuss conditional logic or boolean expressions. The word boolean indicates that something is true or false.

---


#Conditionals

We want the computer to look at an **expression** and evaluate whether it is **true** or **false**, if it's true do one thing, and if it's false do another. Let's take a look at some expressions and evaluate them as true or false.

- 26>5 ‚Üí 26 is greater than 5. Let's read that as a question. Is 26 greater than 5? Yes it is. This expression evaluates to "true."
- 10=14 ‚Üí Since 10 is not equal to 14. This expression evaluates to "false"
- 4>210 ‚Üí This expression is also "false"
- 2=2 ‚Üí "true"

???

- **Using Variables in Conditional Statements**
    - The statements we have written so far are pretty pointless. 5 will always be less than 6 and 5 will never be less than 4, so there can only be one result from these statements. These are pretty fixed.
    - On the other hand, we've had already written expressions using values that are constantly changing. They were called variables, and while some of them don't change (like when we create variables for the size or static location of a shape), some of them are changing all the time.
    - `mouseX` and `mouseY` are two of the built-in variables that we used. The value of the mouse location changes whenever you move your mouse. If we wrote the boolean expression `mouseX>100` it can be true or false. If the mouse were anywhere between 0 and 100 pixels on the x-axis, this expression would evaluate to false. If the mouse were anywhere between 101 and the width of the canvas, the expression would evaluate to true.
    - Let's write a sketch that will turn the background black `if(mouseX>300)`. `300` is the center of our 600-pixel wide canvas so it will be easy to tell if our conditional is working. Based on our statement, if the value of `mouseX` is greater than `300`, the background should turn black. We are also going to set an initial color for the canvas (I set it to white.) That way when my conditional evaluates to false when `mouseX < 300`, the canvas will turn white again.
    - Show this code to your students or have them code along and use `console.log(mouseX)` so that students can see how the condition in the if statement is satisfied. Move the mouse back and forth a few times so that the background changes color when `mouseX` increases and decreases.

Change this example and try turning the canvas black when the Y position of your mouse is greater than 60, or another number. See what happens when you change the variable to mouseY.


---

#Changing a `fill()`

- We can use conditionals to change color, size, or any other values in our sketches. We're going to use the same conditional from the last example to change the fill of a square.
- If the X position of the mouse passes the center of the canvas, the fill of the rectangle will turn blue.
- It's important to remember to draw the rectangle after the conditional so that the fill() will be applied to the rect. See this example.

##Changing a Custom Variable with a Conditional

We can also change custom variables inside conditional statements. In this example, both the width and height of the rectangle are determined by a variable called x. That variable is changed inside the conditional statement.

#Make Your Own Interactive Sketch:

Use the mouse position to change a variable and create an interactive sketch.

## **Requirements:**

- Create more than two variations of this shape by writing a conditional statement using the x position and y position of your mouse.
- You can change the color, size or position of a shape. See this example.

# **Extensions**

- Create a condition that will change the fill of a rectangle if the mouse is hovering over the rectangle.
- Hint: You could use && (and) to combine conditions
- Adapt a previous sketch and add interactivity to it.

What does it mean to have 0 vs. 255?

???

- So far, fill has been used to accept only one number, and it's created greyscale drawings. In reality, fill accepts three values in a default color mode called RGB - or Red, Green, Blue.
- We can use these colors to change elements of our drawing, however, we need to be aware that they work differently than colors we may have used in art classes. If you run this project, you will see three circles in red, green, and blue that overlap and mix - yet this mixing is probably different than what you are used to.
- This is because computers use additive mixing, a process that adds different colored lights to create color. Traditional media uses subtractive mixing, which absorbs different colored lights to create color. (an in-depth explanation of the RGB color model can be found [here](http://dba.med.sc.edu/price/irf/Adobe_tg/models/rgbcmy.html) )

- `ellipse(100, 100, 100, 100);`
- `fill(0, 255, 0);`
- `ellipse(170, 100, 100, 100);`
- `fill(0, 0, 255);`
- `ellipse(145, 150, 100, 100);`

##But wait! There is more!

`fill()` has a 4th argument - Opacity

.center[<iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/mrporterphysics/sketches/8lSbxz3w3" width = "1100 px" height = "450 px"></iframe>]

???

- In our mixing program, we have also adjusted the transparency (the optional fourth value in fill) to allow colors to mix. Its range is 0 (transparent: not visible) to 255 (opaque). You will notice that when we want to change fill, we call a new color before the shape we want to change. Because the draw function is a repeated loop, this presents one color from being applied to every shape.

##`random()` vs. `rect()` and `ellipse()`

- We can also place our ellipse at a random position each time our program runs. To do this, we use p5's random function. This function is different from other functions we have been using (like `ellipse` and `rect`) in that it returns a value. Each time they are called:

--
  - `random(50, 100)` returns a number between 50 and 100

--
  - `random(1, 5)` returns a number between 1 and 5

--
- When the first parameter is omitted, random assumes it is 0:

--
  - `random(100)` returns a number between 0 and 100

--
  - `random(5)` returns a number between 0 and 5

---

#Custom Variables

- Creating a Variable:

--
  1. **Declare** Declaring our variable is basically just telling the program ‚Äúhey! I‚Äôm creating a variable, and this is what it‚Äôs going to be called.‚Äù All you need to do when you want to declare a variable is write the term " `var variableName`"

--
  2. **Initialize** - give variableName a value. This is called an assignment operation. We are assigning a value to our variable. If I write `variableName = 50`, every time I use my variable name, the program will replace it with the number 50.

--
  3. **Use the variable** - Your code won‚Äôt break if you don‚Äôt use the variable, but then what was the point? If we add an `ellipse at ellipse(100,100,variableName,variableName)`, our ellipse will be 50px wide and 50px high.

.qotd[‚ùì of the üìÜ: Who is your favorite superhero?]

### Do Now:
- ‚è≥5 Minutes: Open up p5.js editor and and draw an ellipse that is ***perfectly*** centered in the canvas
- If you finish early, add a rectangle with the same width and height behind the circle.

--
- Was this process frustrating? Why?

--
- What happens if you change the size of your canvas? (Hint: try it)

## Variables

- What is a variable?
--

  - In computer science, variables are placeholder names for actual values
  - They are used to store data that can be used and manipulated in a program
  - They allow us to label data with names that make our code more understandable.

--

### .center[Example:  `let colorOfEyes = 'green';`]

---

## p5.js System Variables

The p5.js library has a number of system variables (built-in) that store data. Today we‚Äôre going to look at:

- `width` and `height`

--
- `mouseX` and `mouseY`

---

###How can we use `width` and `height` to center our ellipse?

--

#`ellipse(width/2, height/2, 30, 30);`

---

#Activity üíª: Paired programming

‚è≤ 10 minutes

With your partner (randomly assiged in breakout rooms)

Create an ellipse that is:

- ‚Öì of the way across the screen
- ¬º of the way across the screen
- ‚Öî of the way across the screen
- ¬æ of the way across the screen

**Save this file and <u>BOTH</u> of you will turn this file in!**

---

###Using `mouseX` and `mouseY`

Why was this code helpful? (What does it do?)

```
function draw() {
	background(100);
	text(mouseX + ", " + mouseY, 20, 20);
}

```

--

- The `mouseX` variable holds the value of the x-coordinate of the current mouse location.
- The `mouseY` variable holds the value of the y-coordinate of the current mouse location.
- The values of these two variables will update in real-time as you move your mouse over the canvas.

---

##What happens?

```
function setup(){
  createCanvas(400,400);
}

function draw(){
  background(mouseX);
  ellipse(width/2,height/2, mouseY);
}
```

---

#Interactivity

- These two simple system variables are what p5.js is all about - they easily allow us to make our projects **interactive** and fun for the user.
- **Interactivity** is the ability of a computer program to respond to the user‚Äôs **input**. The computer will **process** this input data to produce an **output**.

---

##Try It:

1. Make an ellipse follow your mouse
2. Make a rectangle follow your mouse

What is similar? What is different?

---

#`rectMode()`

`rectMode()` allows you to change the reference point for drawing rectangles to the center. You do that with `rectMode(CENTER);`


---
#üíª Paired Programming

With your partner (randomly assiged in breakout rooms)

- Use `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` to change the height or width of a rectangle
- Use `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` to change the height or width of an ellipse
- Use `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` to change the shade of the canvas
- Use `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` to change the fill of a rectangle or ellipse
- üîå Extension: Create a triangle that follows your mouse

**Save this file and <u>BOTH</u> of you will turn this file in!**

Note: You can comment out each task after you complete it so you can submit one file.

For example:

```javascript
//ellipse centered
//ellipse(width/2, height/2, 50,50);

//ellipse 1/3 across the screen
ellipse(width/3, height/2, 50,50);
```

##üîå Unplugged...Draw a robot...

Draw a robot using:

- Using only rectangles, circles, and ellipses
- Using at *least* 5 total shapes

##Why?

We need to practice giving instructions. Coding is all about giving a computer instructions that it will understand.

---

In p5 we use code to draw graphics on a canvas:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/visualoutcome.png" width = "700px"/>


---

The coordinate system is different...

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/coordinategrid.png" width = "700px"/>

---

Adjust your robot's coordinates:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/robot.png" width = "500px"/>



---

##Rectangles:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/heightwidthsquare.png" width = "400px"/>

##Ellipses:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/heightwidth.png" width = "400px"/>

---

#Write the info for your robot....

List the shapes and write down their information

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/shapeinstructions.png" width = "700px"/>

---


#The Code

###Set up the windown
```javascript

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}
```

###A continuous loop
```javascript
function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```
