#AP Physics 1 - 2017 Question 4

##Part (a) - 3 points

Correct answer: “No”
Note: If the wrong answer is selected, partial credit can be earned for the justification.
- 1 point: For attempting to use conservation of energy to compare the two blocks
- 1 point: For explicitly or implicitly indicating that the launch velocities are different
- 1 point: For stating or implying that the time to reach the ground is the same for both blocks

Example: The amount of potential energy converted to kinetic energy is different for the
two blocks. The potential energy is proportional to the change in height, which is
smaller for block 2. Therefore, at the edge of the table, block 1 will have more
kinetic energy than block 2, and hence a larger speed. The launches are both
horizontal and from the same height, so the blocks will spend the same amount of
time in the air. Because `\(d=vt\)`, the distances will be different for the two blocks (as
the speeds are different).

#AP Physics 1 - 2017 Question 4

##Part (b i.) - 2 points

Correct answer: “The two blocks land the same distance from their respective tables.”

- 1 Point: For indicating that the change in potential energy from release to launch is the same for
the two cases
- 1 Point: For an indication (explicit or implicit) that the launch velocities are the same

#AP Physics 1 - 2017 Question 4

##Part (b ii.) - 2 points

Correct answer: “Block 1”

- 1 Point: For indicating that the average speed or velocity on the slide is higher for Team 1, OR
that block 1 reaches its maximum speed in less time
- 1 Point: For a valid explanation of why the average speed or velocity is higher for team 1, OR
why block 1 reaches its maximum speed in less time

Example: Because the ramp on Table 1 is initially steeper, block 1 has a higher average
speed while it’s on the ramp so it launches off the table before block 2.
