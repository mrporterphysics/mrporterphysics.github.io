# Sea-Floor Spreading Lab
## Introduction Slides

---

# Welcome to Sea-Floor Spreading Lab

## Goals of Today's Lab:
* 🎯 Understand magnetic reversals in oceanic crust
* 📊 Learn key evidence for sea-floor spreading
* 📈 Practice data analysis and plotting skills

*Remember: This lab connects directly to our study of plate tectonics!*

---

# The Discovery - A Scientific Detective Story

## Historical Context (1950s):
* Scientists were searching for submarines 🚢
* Used magnetic detection equipment
* Made an unexpected discovery!

## What They Found:
* Strange magnetic patterns on the ocean floor
* Symmetrical "stripes" of magnetism

---

# Magnetic Reversals and Rock Formation

## Key Concepts:
* Earth's magnetic field periodically "flips"
  * North becomes South
  * South becomes North
  * Happens every few hundred thousand years

---

# Magnetic Reversals and Rock Formation

## How Rocks Record Magnetism:
1. Magma rises at mid-ocean ridges
2. Magnetic minerals align with Earth's field
3. Rock solidifies, preserving the alignment
4. Creates a permanent record

---

# Today's Investigation

## What You'll Do:
1. Plot real magnetic data from the ocean floor
2. Look for patterns on both sides of the ridge
3. Calculate ages and distances
4. Draw conclusions based on evidence

---

# Making Your Plot

## Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Label your axes
   * X-axis: Longitude (30°W to 15°E)
   * Y-axis: Age (0 to 180 million years)

2. Plot the points
   * Use one color for Normal polarity (N)
   * Use different color for Reversed polarity (S)

3. Mark the ridge location 

---

# Analysis Tips

## Look For:
* Symmetry in the pattern
* Age relationships
* Distance relationships

## Think About:
* Why are the patterns symmetrical?
* What does this tell us about sea-floor spreading?
* How does this support plate tectonic theory?

---

# Time Management:
* Plotting data: 15 minutes
* Analysis questions: 20 minutes
* Class discussion: 10 minutes
