### *Crashworthiness*:  **how well a car protects its occupants in a crash**

Your task is to make the most crashworthy paper car. It will be protecting an egg. 

---

# Crashworthiness 

How can we measure the most crashworthy car? 

- ***Momentum*** can be conisdered a measure of how difficult it is to stop an object in motion

Momentum $p=mv$ (mass times velocity)

---

# Contest

Make a paper car with ***the most*** momentum at the bottom of the ramp that still allows an egg to survive.

- Vehicle designs must allow for easy access to and removal of the egg (occupant) for inspection after the crash.
-  Vehicle designs should be able to withstand 2-3 trials/collisions without parts replacement or repairs.
-  All vehicles must visibly display the following information on their frames:

## **The La Quebrada Cliff Divers provide daily entertainment for the crowds at Acapulco, Mexico. As a group of professional high divers, they dive off the cliff of La Quebrada and fall $46.2\textrm{ meters}$ to the water below. More than an act of bravery, the cliff divers must time their dive so that they hit the water when the crest of an incoming wave has arrived. Determine the speed with which Pedro must run off the cliff in order to land in the water a horizontal distance of $10.8\textrm{ meters}$ from the edge of the cliff.**

### Question

A red car (on left) and a green car (on right) are spaced 1200 m apart (distance a). They start at the same time and head towards each other. The red car averages a speed of 13.5 m/s. The green car averages a speed of 15.2 m/s. **How much time will the two cars have traveled when they are at the same position?**

![center w:700](image-5.png)

### Hints & Tips:

1. Sketch a position vs. time graph with the motion of both cars on it. 
    - What is happening where the lines intersect?
2. Write the equation of motion for each car. 
    - Remember: $x = vt + x_i$

# Pasta Bridge Lab 🍝

## Objective: 

* Determine the strength of a pasta bridge by finding the relationship between strength (number of marbles) and strands of pasta
* Compare bridge strength of two varieties of pasta

---

# Presenting:

1. How you ran your lab (what was your procedure)
2. What you found:
    - Does your data confirm or deny your hypothesis? How so?
3. Anything else interesting you found

---

# Pasta Bridge Lab 🍝

- What does the slope represent?
  - Can you write a "for each" statment?
- What does the intercept represent?
- How do the slope and/or intercept help support or refute your hypothesis?
  - Do other groups' data agree with yours?

---

# Post Lab

* **Discussion of results**: 
  - Interpret your results in the context of the experiment's objectives.
  - Explain any patterns or trends observed in the data
* **Comparison with hypotheses**: 
  - Explicitly state whether your results support or refute your hypotheses.
  - Discuss possible reasons for any discrepancies.
* **Sources of error and uncertainty**: 
  - Identify potential sources of experimental error.
  - Discuss how these might have affected your results.
  - Quantify uncertainties where possible.

---

# Post Lab

- **Conclusions**: 
  - Summarize the main findings of the experiment.
  - Relate these back to the original objectives and broader scientific principles.
  - Suggest improvements or future directions for the experiment.

# What is a Lab Notebook?

* A detailed, chronological record of a scientist's research activities, experiments, and observations. 
* Documentation of the scientific process from intial ideas to final results and conclusions. 

---

# Why keep lab notebooks?

* Document Research
* Develop Ideas
* Organize Data 
* Collaboration Tool
* Publication Support
* Troubleshooting 
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Historical Record

---

# Lab Notebooks can be Legal Documents 

* Proof of invention in Patent Cases
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Admissibility in court - must be properly maintained
* Note: Often property of the instituation where the research was conducted (i.e. Property of Regeneron, or Property of Cornell University)

---

# Remember

* Lab notebooks are most importantly scientific documentation
* They represent the scientific process and are record of your **thinking**
    * This means your ideas and conclusions and hypotheses can **change** based on **new data**

---

# Lab Notebook

* Write in **pen**
* All mistakes get a ~~single cross through~~
* Full Date (YYYY/MM/DD) at the beginning of each entry (for multiday labs date start of each day)
* Enter Lab Pages into table of contents 

---

# Lab Notebook - Pre Lab

* **Title and objective of the experiment**: 
  - Write a clear, concise title for each experiment.
  - State the main objective or purpose of the experiment in 1-2 sentences.
* ***Theoretical background**: 
  - Briefly explain the relevant scientific principles.
  - Include key equations or concepts that will be tested or applied.
* **Hypotheses**: 

  - State your predictions about the experiment's outcome.
  - Base these on your understanding of the theory.

---

# Lab Notebook - Pre Lab

* **Materials and equipment list**: 
  - Provide a detailed list of all materials and equipment used.
  - Include model numbers and specifications where relevant.
* **Experimental procedure outline**: 
  - Write a step-by-step outline of the planned procedure.
  - Be specific enough that someone could replicate your experiment.

---
