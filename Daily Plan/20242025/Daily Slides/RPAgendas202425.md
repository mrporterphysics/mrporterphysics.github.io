### Question

A red car (on left) and a green car (on right) are spaced 1200 m apart (distance a). They start at the same time and head towards each other. The red car averages a speed of 13.5 m/s. The green car averages a speed of 15.2 m/s. **How much time will the two cars have traveled when they are at the same position?**

![center w:700](image-5.png)

</div>
 
<div>

### Hints & Tips:

1. Sketch a position vs. time graph with the motion of both cars on it. 
    - What is happening where the lines intersect?
2. Write the equation of motion for each car. 
    - Remember: $x = vt + x_i$ 
3. How can you use the equations to find the tim that they intersect?

# What is a Lab Notebook?

* A detailed, chronological record of a scientist's research activities, experiments, and observations. 
* Documentation of the scientific process from intial ideas to final results and conclusions. 

---

# Why keep lab notebooks?

* Document Research
* Develop Ideas
* Organize Data 
* Collaboration Tool
* Publication Support
* Troubleshooting 
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Historical Record

---

# Lab Notebooks can be Legal Documents 

* Proof of invention in Patent Cases
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Admissibility in court - must be properly maintained
* Note: Often property of the instituation where the research was conducted (i.e. Property of Regeneron, or Property of Cornell University)

---

# Remember

* Lab notebooks are most importantly scientific documentation
* They represent the scientific process and are record of your **thinking**
    * This means your ideas and conclusions and hypotheses can **change** based on **new data**

---

# Lab Notebook

* Write in **pen**
* All mistakes get a ~~single cross through~~
* Full Date (YYYY/MM/DD) at the beginning of each entry (for multiday labs date start of each day)
* Enter Lab Pages into table of contents 

---

# Lab Notebook - Pre Lab

* **Title and objective of the experiment**: 
  - Write a clear, concise title for each experiment.
  - State the main objective or purpose of the experiment in 1-2 sentences.
