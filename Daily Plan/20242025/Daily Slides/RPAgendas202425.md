## 2024.02.05 **Regents Physics** Do Now:

1. Tyrone, South's $75.8$-kg halfback, is moving with a speed of $7.03$ m/s when he collides with a middle linebacker. If Tyrone experiences a force of $841$ N over a time period of $1.13$ s, then determine his final speed.
2. A $1.05$-kg rubber ball moving with a speed of $7.53$ m/s strikes a wall and rebounds with a speed of $2.21$ m/s in the opposite direction. Determine the impulse.
3. While playing basketball, Logan lost his balance and collied with the padded wall behind the basket. His $72.8$-kg body decelerated from $7.67$ m/s to $0$ m/s in $0.150$ seconds. Determine the force acting upon Logan's body.

#### 📋 Agenda

0. Do Now
1. How did the classwork go? Questions
2. Introduce Paper Car Crash Experiment
3. Paper Car Crash: Planning, Building, and Documentation in Lab Notebook


### 🎯 Goals

🥅 _Use Impulse-Momentum Theorem to make a crash design_

---

# 🎯 Most Crashworthy Car 

### *Crashworthiness*:  **how well a car protects its occupants in a crash**

Your task is to make the most crashworthy paper car. It will be protecting an egg. 

---

# Crashworthiness 

How can we measure the most crashworthy car? 

- ***Momentum*** can be conisdered a measure of how difficult it is to stop an object in motion

Momentum $p=mv$ (mass times velocity)

---

# Contest

Make a paper car with ***the most*** momentum at the bottom of the ramp that still allows an egg to survive. 

---

# **🚗 Car Supplies 📰**

- 2 pieces of copy paper
- 1 straw to use for car axles
- 2 axles & 4 wheels
- scotch tape 

---

# Additional Rules & Requirements 

- Car must fit on gutter ramp
- Vehicle designs must allow for easy access to and removal of the egg (occupant) for inspection after the crash.
-  Vehicle designs should be able to withstand 2-3 trials/collisions without parts replacement or repairs.
-  All vehicles must visibly display the following information on their frames:
    - vehicle name, builder’s name, vehicle length in centimeters, vehicle mass in grams

### Question

A red car (on left) and a green car (on right) are spaced 1200 m apart (distance a). They start at the same time and head towards each other. The red car averages a speed of 13.5 m/s. The green car averages a speed of 15.2 m/s. **How much time will the two cars have traveled when they are at the same position?**

![center w:700](image-5.png)

</div>
 
<div>

### Hints & Tips:

1. Sketch a position vs. time graph with the motion of both cars on it. 
    - What is happening where the lines intersect?
2. Write the equation of motion for each car. 
    - Remember: $x = vt + x_i$ 
3. How can you use the equations to find the tim that they intersect?

3. Anything else interesting you found

---

# Pasta Bridge Lab 🍝

- What does the slope represent?
  - Can you write a "for each" statment?
- What does the intercept represent?
- How do the slope and/or intercept help support or refute your hypothesis?
  - Do other groups' data agree with yours?

---

# Post Lab

* **Discussion of results**: 
  - Interpret your results in the context of the experiment's objectives.
  - Explain any patterns or trends observed in the data
* **Comparison with hypotheses**: 
  - Explicitly state whether your results support or refute your hypotheses.
  - Discuss possible reasons for any discrepancies.
* **Sources of error and uncertainty**: 
  - Identify potential sources of experimental error.
  - Discuss how these might have affected your results.
  - Quantify uncertainties where possible.

---

# Post Lab

- **Conclusions**: 
  - Summarize the main findings of the experiment.
  - Relate these back to the original objectives and broader scientific principles.
  - Suggest improvements or future directions for the experiment.

# Remember

* Lab notebooks are most importantly scientific documentation
* They represent the scientific process and are record of your **thinking**
    * This means your ideas and conclusions and hypotheses can **change** based on **new data**

---

# Lab Notebook

* Write in **pen**
* All mistakes get a ~~single cross through~~
* Full Date (YYYY/MM/DD) at the beginning of each entry (for multiday labs date start of each day)
* Enter Lab Pages into table of contents
