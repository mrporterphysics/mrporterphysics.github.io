# 2024.12.04 **AP Physics** Do Now 

The two blocks are identical and both are at rest. A student comparing the normal force exerted on the block by the surface in the two cases states:

_**“Since both blocks are identical, I think the normal forces are the same because in each case the normal force will be equal to the weight.”**_

What, if anything, is wrong with this contention? If something is wrong, identify it and explain how to correct it. If this contention is correct, explain why.

# **Gravity: $\vec{F_g}$**

## **Notes:**

* Weight == $F_g$ == Force of Gravity...so $F_g = mg$
* Weight is a **FORCE**, mass is scalar quantity
* $g$ is the gravitational field strength
    * Measured in N/kg 
    * changes based on planet and location on that planet
    * _near the surface of the Earth_ $g = 9.8 \textrm{ N/kg}$
      * You can round this to $g = 10 \textrm{ N/kg}$

# Test Corrections - Notes and FAQs

- Usually about a week to complete
- You **cannot** do them at home or outside of the classroom (AP Police will find us)
- No I will not tell you what you did before
- You may come work during study hall -> But I will not be able to help you if I have a class. 
    - take your test and work on it in the breakout space outside of my classroom, or in the middle room.
- Curve is $\sqrt{\frac{\text{points earned} + \text{1/2 points back}}{\text{total points}}}$

# Test Corrections

1. Determine correct answer for incorrect questions
    + For FRQ you need to correct the entire part (i.e. part (a)) if you lost *any* points
    + No you cannot see what you put before - start from scratch
2. For MC questions you must provide a justification 
    - Start with a **fact of physics** "_slope of VT is acceleration_" or "_area of VT is displacement_"
    - Draw a diagram to help (i.e. draw a VT graph)
    - Try to use a claim evidence reasoning format to write your justification
4. Finally, compare your new, correct answers to your test and determine if your mistake was one of the 4 C's: clueless, careless, conceptual, or calculation.

---

# **Test Corrections Summary**

4. Look for trends about what your test performance:
    - Were there certain types of questions you missed?
    - Do you need to review/relearn/learn some material that was tested?
        - What learning mastery standard do you think that material aligns with?
    - Was there a common mistake you made?
    - Summarize
5. Meet with Mr. Porter to discuss the trends **before** you turn in your corrections.

A Car is moving with constant speed $v_0$ when a tree falls into the roadway at $t=0$. It takes the driver a time $T$ to react and apply the brakes. The car then slows with a constant acceleration of magnitude $a$. Which of the following equations correctly expressed the distance $D$ traveled by the car from $t=0$ to the instant the car comes to rest?

A. $D = v_0T + \frac{1}{2}aT^2$

B. $D = \frac{1}{2}aT^2 + \frac{v_0^2}{2a}$

C. $D = v_0T + \frac{v_0^2}{2a}$

D. $D = v_0T + \frac{1}{2}aT^2 + \frac{v_0^2}{2a}$

# What is a Lab Notebook?

* A detailed, chronological record of a scientist's research activities, experiments, and observations. 
* Documentation of the scientific process from intial ideas to final results and conclusions. 

---

# Why keep lab notebooks?

* Document Research
* Develop Ideas
* Organize Data 
* Collaboration Tool
* Publication Support
* Troubleshooting 
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Historical Record

---

# Lab Notebooks can be Legal Documents 

* Proof of invention in Patent Cases
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Admissibility in court - must be properly maintained
* Note: Often property of the instituation where the research was conducted (i.e. Property of Regeneron, or Property of Cornell University)

---

# Remember

* Lab notebooks are most importantly scientific documentation
* They represent the scientific process and are record of your **thinking**
    * This means your ideas and conclusions and hypotheses can **change** based on **new data**

---

# Lab Notebook

* Write in **pen**
* All mistakes get a ~~single cross through~~
* Full Date (YYYY/MM/DD) at the beginning of each entry (for multiday labs date start of each day)
* Enter Lab Pages into table of contents 

---

# Lab Notebook - Pre Lab

* **Title and objective of the experiment**: 
  - Write a clear, concise title for each experiment.
  - State the main objective or purpose of the experiment in 1-2 sentences.
* ***Theoretical background**: 
  - Briefly explain the relevant scientific principles.
  - Include key equations or concepts that will be tested or applied.
* **Hypotheses**: 

  - State your predictions about the experiment's outcome.
  - Base these on your understanding of the theory.

---

# Lab Notebook - Pre Lab

* **Materials and equipment list**: 
  - Provide a detailed list of all materials and equipment used.
  - Include model numbers and specifications where relevant.
* **Experimental procedure outline**: 
  - Write a step-by-step outline of the planned procedure.
  - Be specific enough that someone could replicate your experiment.

# During the Experiment

* **Raw data in tables with units**: 
  - Create neat, organized tables for all numerical data.
  - Always include units and uncertainty estimates.
  - Label columns clearly and use consistent significant figures.
* **Observations and qualitative notes**: 
  - Record all relevant observations, even if they seem unimportant.
  - Note any unexpected occurrences or anomalies.
* **Any changes to the planned procedure**: 
  - Document any deviations from the original procedure.
  - Explain why changes were made and how they might affect results.
* **Sketches or diagrams of experimental setup**: 
  - Include clear, labeled diagrams of your experimental setup.
  - Add dimensions and important details to aid in replication.

---

# Post Lab

* **Data analysis and calculations**: 
  - Show all steps in your calculations, including formulas used.
  - Explain your reasoning for each step of the analysis.
* **Graphs and charts**: 
  - Create neat, properly labeled graphs and charts.
  - Include titles, axis labels with units, and legends where appropriate.

---

# Post Lab

* **Discussion of results**: 
  - Interpret your results in the context of the experiment's objectives.
  - Explain any patterns or trends observed in the data
* **Comparison with hypotheses**: 
  - Explicitly state whether your results support or refute your hypotheses.
  - Discuss possible reasons for any discrepancies.
* **Sources of error and uncertainty**: 
  - Identify potential sources of experimental error.
  - Discuss how these might have affected your results.
  - Quantify uncertainties where possible.

---

# Post Lab

- **Conclusions**: 
  - Summarize the main findings of the experiment.
  - Relate these back to the original objectives and broader scientific principles.
  - Suggest improvements or future directions for the experiment.
