# Using Graphs to Make Predictions

## "For Every" Statement

* The [**y variable**] [increases/decreases/remains the same] [slope value] [y variable units] _for every_ 1 [x units] of [x variable] change.

* A slope of 12 cm/s would give the following statement
    * _The **position** increases 12 cm for every 1 second of **time** change._

---

# Calculating Slope

<br>
<br>
<br>


$$\boxed{slope = m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}}$$

---

# Calculuate Slope

1. Find two points on best fit line:
    - $(50, 18)$ and $(10,6)$
2. Use Slope Formula

$$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \frac{18-6}{50-10} $$

3. Add in units
![bg fit right](image-30.png)

$$m = \frac{12 \text{ cm}}{40 \text{ g}}$$

# Experiments

## Typical Goal: 
to determine the effect of one quantity upon another quantity.

## Example: 
How does the **mass** of an object affect its **acceleration**? That is, to determine the effect of **mass** upon **acceleration**.

---

## ***Variable*** - a quantity that changes or varies.

### Independent Variable: 
the variable that the scientist intentionally changes each trial.


### Dependent Variable: 

the variable that changes in response to the changes that are made to the independent variable.

---

## Dependent vs Independent Variable

### Purpose: 
to determine the effect of mass upon the acceleration of an object.
### Independent Variable: 
mass (it is varied by the scientist from trial to trial)
### Dependent Variable: 
acceleration (it varies in response to changes in the mass)

---

# Dependent vs Independent Variable

![center](image-23.png)

---

# DRY MIX

### **D**ependent - **R**esponding - **Y**-axis

The dependent variable changes in response to the other variable; its values are plotted on the y-axis.

### **M**anipulated - **I**ndependent - **X**-axis
The independent variable is the one that is manipulated or changed by the scientist; values are plotted on the x-axis.

---

## What types of patterns are possible?

1. Linear Relationship
2. Non- or Constant Relationship
3. Quadratic Relationship
4. Inverse Relationship

---

# Linear Relationship

Any given change in the independent variable (x) will always produce the same change in the dependent variable (y). 

<div class='columns'>
<div>

When x changes by a certain amount (1 unit), the value of y always changes by the same amount (e.g., 2 units).

# CER Practice:

### A lab is performed to determine whether or not a car driving along Lake Avenue is speeding.

**Which is an appropriate Claim for the Conclusion section of such a lab?**

1. We analyzed the car’s motion, plotted it on the computer and determined its speed.
2.  This was a great lab! We had a lot of fun finding the speed of the car. We should do more of these.
3. We determined that the speed of the car was 49 mi/hr.
4. The car we analyzed was speeding.
