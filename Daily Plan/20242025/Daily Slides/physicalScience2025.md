# Experiments

## Typical Goal: 
to determine the effect of one quantity upon another quantity.

## Example: 
How does the **mass** of an object affect its **acceleration**? That is, to determine the effect of **mass** upon **acceleration**.

---

## ***Variable*** - a quantity that changes or varies.

### Independent Variable: 
the variable that the scientist intentionally changes each trial.


### Dependent Variable: 

the variable that changes in response to the changes that are made to the independent variable.

---

## Dependent vs Independent Variable

### Purpose: 
to determine the effect of mass upon the acceleration of an object.
### Independent Variable: 
mass (it is varied by the scientist from trial to trial)
### Dependent Variable: 
acceleration (it varies in response to changes in the mass)

---

# Dependent vs Independent Variable

![center](image-23.png)

---

# DRY MIX

### **D**ependent - **R**esponding - **Y**-axis

The dependent variable changes in response to the other variable; its values are plotted on the y-axis.

### **M**anipulated - **I**ndependent - **X**-axis
The independent variable is the one that is manipulated or changed by the scientist; values are plotted on the x-axis.

---

## What types of patterns are possible?

1. Linear Relationship
2. Non- or Constant Relationship
3. Quadratic Relationship
4. Inverse Relationship

---

# Linear Relationship

Any given change in the independent variable (x) will always produce the same change in the dependent variable (y). 

<div class='columns'>
<div>

When x changes by a certain amount (1 unit), the value of y always changes by the same amount (e.g., 2 units).

# Non-Relationship 

## (or Constant Relationship)
A change in one variable will have no effect upon the value of the other variable. 

<div class='columns'>
<div>
As the value of x changes, the value of y remains constant.

<br>
<br>
<br>
X has NO effect upon Y.

# Quadratic Relationship

Most commonly, a quadratic will show an exponent of 2, indicating that the y value depends on the square of x. 

<div class='columns'>
<div>
Whatever change is made to x, the square of that change is made to y.

# Inverse Relationship 

An increase in one variable causes a decrease in the other variable. 

<div class='columns'>
<div>
Whatever change is made to x, the reciprocal change is made to y.

# The Big Idea üí°

## Throughout the year we will do experiments and collect data for the dependent and independent variables.

## Then we will need to identify the type of relationship from the patterns that we observe in the data.

# CER in AP Physics:

* ***Claim***:
    * Sentence that answers the question.

* ***Evidence***:
    * Explanation of how the evidence supports the claim.
        * Should include details!
        * Refer back to the question, include any data, diagrams, or graphs.

* ***Reasoning***:
    * Physics principle, such as an equation, law, or definition.
        * This is general, do no include specific details.

# CER Practice:

### A lab is performed to determine whether or not a car driving along Lake Avenue is speeding.

**Which is an appropriate Claim for the Conclusion section of such a lab?**

1. We analyzed the car‚Äôs motion, plotted it on the computer and determined its speed.
2.  This was a great lab! We had a lot of fun finding the speed of the car. We should do more of these.
3. We determined that the speed of the car was 49 mi/hr.
4. The car we analyzed was speeding.

# CER Practice:

### A lab is performed to determine whether or not a car driving along Lake Avenue is speeding.

**Which is an appropriate statement of the *Evidence* for the Conclusion section of such a lab?**

1. The car was speeding.
2. The calculated the slope of the line. We might have made an error in the calculation but it was 49 mi/hr.
3. The position-time plot of the car‚Äôs motion is shown in the Data section. The slope of the line was found to be 49 mi/hr. This is 4 mi/hr over the speed limit.

# CER Practice:

### A lab is performed to determine whether or not a car driving along Lake Avenue is speeding.

**Which is an appropriate statement of the Reasoning for the Conclusion section of such a lab?**

1. Speed limit signs are always clearly posted on the road side.
2. Some cars go faster than other cars. The car we analyzed was speeding.
3. The slope of the line on a position-time plot is equal to the speed of the object.
