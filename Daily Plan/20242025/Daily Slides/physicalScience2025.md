# Dune Buggy Challenge

## 💡 Big Ideas

* We can use models to make predictions
* Collecting Data 
* Use Pivot Tools
* Start Making Scientific Arguments

# CER in AP Physics:

* ***Claim***:
    * Sentence that answers the question.

* ***Evidence***:
    * Explanation of how the evidence supports the claim.
        * Should include details!
        * Refer back to the question, include any data, diagrams, or graphs.

* ***Reasoning***:
    * Physics principle, such as an equation, law, or definition.
        * This is general, do no include specific details.

# CER Practice:

### A lab is performed to determine whether or not a car driving along Lake Avenue is speeding.

**Which is an appropriate Claim for the Conclusion section of such a lab?**

1. We analyzed the car’s motion, plotted it on the computer and determined its speed.
2.  This was a great lab! We had a lot of fun finding the speed of the car. We should do more of these.
3. We determined that the speed of the car was 49 mi/hr.
4. The car we analyzed was speeding.

# CER Practice:

### A lab is performed to determine whether or not a car driving along Lake Avenue is speeding.

**Which is an appropriate statement of the *Evidence* for the Conclusion section of such a lab?**

1. The car was speeding.
2. The calculated the slope of the line. We might have made an error in the calculation but it was 49 mi/hr.
3. The position-time plot of the car’s motion is shown in the Data section. The slope of the line was found to be 49 mi/hr. This is 4 mi/hr over the speed limit.

# CER Practice:

### A lab is performed to determine whether or not a car driving along Lake Avenue is speeding.

**Which is an appropriate statement of the Reasoning for the Conclusion section of such a lab?**

1. Speed limit signs are always clearly posted on the road side.
2. Some cars go faster than other cars. The car we analyzed was speeding.
3. The slope of the line on a position-time plot is equal to the speed of the object.

# Survival Island 🏝️

## You and your group are stranded on an deserted island 😮!

### Using *each* of your **unique skill's** develop a plan to escape the island.

1. Whiteboard your response (one person)
2. Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
