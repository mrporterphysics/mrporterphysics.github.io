# [üé¨What is p5.js?](http://hello.p5js.org/)

- JavaScript Library for creating visual and interactive art (and more!)
- Works with *three* languages: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- This programming language will be used in this course to introduce basic programming concepts and apply them to create computational media by building expressive and interactive computer applications and media.


---


# [Processing](https://processing.org/)

"Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping."

  - Free to download and open source
  - Interactive programs with 2D, 3D, PDF, or SVG output
  - OpenGL integration for accelerated 2D and 3D
  - For GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Android, and ARM
  - Over 100 libraries extend the core software
  - Well documented, with many books available

---

# [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

- Processing, but adapted for javascript
- means you can run it in your internet browser
- Also has an online editor and you can run it with your Chromebooks

# Draw a Robot ü§ñ <!--fit--->

- Find a partner
- Get a whiteboard 
- Split your side in half 
- Draw a robot with **5 Shapes** on your side on one half

In p5 we use code to draw graphics on a canvas:

---

The coordinate system is different...

Adjust your robot's coordinates:

##Rectangles:

##Ellipses:

## üîå Unplugged...Draw a robot...

Draw a robot using:

- Using only rectangles, circles, and ellipses
- Using at *least* 5 total shapes

## Why?

We need to practice giving instructions. Coding is all about giving a computer instructions that it will understand.

---

# Write the info for your robot....

List the shapes and write down their information

# The Code

### Set up the window
```javascript

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}
```

### A continuous loop
```javascript
function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```

# Draw your robot assignment

Draw a robot using:

- Using only rectangles, circles, and ellipses
- Using at *least* 5 total shapes
