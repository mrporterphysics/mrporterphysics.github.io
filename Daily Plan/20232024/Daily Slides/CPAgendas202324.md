1. Describing Motion
2. Motion Sensor Lab

# Describing Motion 

1. Where does the object start?
2. What direction is it moving in?
3. How fast is it moving?

#### Written description of bicyclist A:
Bicyclist A begins at a position of zero, and moves at a constant, fairly high speed (compared to cyclist B) in the positive direction for about 10 seconds, ending at a fairly far in the positive direction from zero.

#### Written description of bicyclist B:
Bicyclist B begins at a position in the positive direction from zero, and moves at a constant, fairly low speed
(compared to cyclist A) in the negative direction for about 10 seconds, ending closer to zero than its starting
position.

---

# Describing Motion 

Each description should include:
- Starting position
- Direction of motion (positive direction, no motion, or negative direction)
- Type of motion (at rest, constant velocity, speeding up, slowing down or some combination of these)
- Relative speed (slow, medium, fast, slower, faster—this is only meaningful with there is more than
one part of the motion or when you are comparing two or more objects)

# Motion Maps 

- Each dot represents **one unit of time**
- The numberline is the **position** of the object
- The separation of the dots and length of the arrow represents the **velocity** of the object 
- Stacked dots represent an object that is motionless

---

# Claim - Evidence - Reasoning 

* ***Claim***:
    * Sentence that answers the question.

* ***Evidence***:
    * Explanation of how the evidence supports the claim.
        * Should include details!
        * Refer back to the question, include any data, diagrams, or graphs.

* Reasoning:
    * Physics principle, such as an equation, law, or definition.
        * This is general, do no include specific details.

# 2023.09.13 **Conceptual Physics** Agenda

##### **❓of the 📅**: Is cake 🍰 better than ice cream 🍨?


1. Whiteboard Pasta Bridge Lab:
    - Graph
    - Equation
2. Board Meeting
    - What does the slope tells us? The intercept?
3. Buggy Lab:

---

# Pasta Bridge Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
- What does the intercept mean?
    - Y-intercept: the vertical value when the horizontal value is zero.

Using *each* of your **unique skill's** develop a plan to escape the island.

Whiteboard your response (one person)

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
