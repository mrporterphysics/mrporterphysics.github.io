# Area of VT Graph 

- Area "under the curve" represents the ***displacement*** (*change in position*) of the object. 
- Areas can be *negative* because that represents the direction

$$ \Delta x = \bar{v}{t} $$

- Add multiple segments together, including the sign to get the total **displacement** of a piecewise motion

# Multiple Representations 

Reminders:

- Motion map shows the **position** on a number line at different **times**
    - each dot represents a different time, the position is where you put it
- **Velocity** is the slope of the **position vs. time** graph
    - Slope $v = \Delta x / \Delta t$ (this is $\Delta y / \Delta x$) but **position** (**$x$**) is on the vertical axis and **time** (**$t$**) is on the horizontal axis.

# Distance, Position, & Displacement 

* ***Distance*** ‚Äì How far something has traveled along some path. 
    - Symbol: $d$
* ***Position*** ‚Äì Where something is located in some reference system. 
    - Symbol: $\vec{x}$
* ***Displacement*** ‚Äì The difference between an object‚Äôs starting position and its ending position. 
    - Symbol: $\Delta \vec{x}$

---

# Number Lines 

Now consider an object that takes a trip along the number line, beginning at a position of +2 meters, and ending at a position of +7 meters.

![center](../images/Kinematics/numberlinetrip1.png)

How would we describe the distance, position(s), and displacement associated with this trip?

---

# Trip 1

![center](../images/Kinematics/numberlinetrip1.png)

The object has a **starting position** of +2 meters.
The object has and **ending position** of +7 meters.
The object traveled a **distance** along the number line of 5 meters.
The object had a **displacement** of 5 meters in the *positive direction* or +5 meters.

---

# Trip 2

What if the object reversed its trip, starting at a position of +7 meters and ending at a position of +2 meters?

Which of the quantities above have changed as a result of this new trip?

![center](../images/Kinematics/numberlinetrip2.png)

---

# Trip 2

![center](../images/Kinematics/numberlinetrip2.png)

The object has a **starting position** of +7 meters.
The object has and **ending position** of +2 meters.
The object traveled a **distance** along the number line of 5 meters.
The object had a **displacement** of 5 meters in the *negative direction* or -5 meters.

---

# Trip 3

Finally, let us consider a more complicated trip along the number line in order to more fully illustrate the difference between distance and displacement. Consider an object that travels from a position of +2 meters to a position of +9 meters and then turns around and goes back to a position of +7 meters.

![center](../images/Kinematics/numberlinetrip3.png)

---

# Trip 3

![center](../images/Kinematics/numberlinetrip3.png)

The object has a **starting position** of +2 meters.
The object has an **intermediate position** of +9 meters, which is where it changed directions.
The object has and **ending position** of +7 meters.
The object traveled a **distance** along the number line of 9 meters.
The object had a **displacement** of 5 meters in the *positive direction* or +5 meters.

---

# Speed vs. Velocity 

## Speed 

average speed = distance / time 

$$\bar{v} = \frac{d}{\Delta t}$$

## Velocity 

Rate and direction, velocity = displacement / time elapsed 

$$\vec{\bar{v}}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

---

# Example Calculations 

![center](../images/Kinematics/calcexampleimage.png)

---

# Example Calculations - Displacement

![center](../images/Kinematics/calcexampleimage.png)

* Initial Position ($\vec{x_i}$) = 0.0 cm
* Final Position ($\vec{x_f}$) = 6.0 cm
* $\Delta \vec{x} = \vec{x_f} - \vec{x_i}$
* $\Delta \vec{x} = 6.0 \textrm{ cm} - 0.0 \textrm{ cm}$
* $\Delta \vec{x} = 6 \textrm{ cm}$

---

# Example Calculations - Time

![center](../images/Kinematics/calcexampleimage.png)

* Initial Clock Reading ($\vec{x_i}$) = 0.0 cm
* Final Clock Reading ($\vec{x_f}$) = 6.0 cm
* $\Delta t = t_f - t_i$
* $\Delta t = 3.0 \textrm{ s} - 0.0 \textrm{ cm}$
* $\Delta t = 3.0 \textrm{ s}$

---


# Calculations - Average Velocity

![center](../images/Kinematics/calcexampleimage.png)

* $\textrm{average velocity} = \frac{\textrm{change in position}}{\textrm{change in time}}$
* $\vec{\bar{v}}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
* $\vec{\bar{v}}=\frac{6.0 \textrm{ cm}}{3.0 \textrm{ s}}$
* $\vec{\bar{v}}= 2.0 \frac{\textrm{cm}}{\textrm{s}}$

# Describing Motion

#### Written description of bicyclist A:
Bicyclist A begins at a position of zero, and moves at a constant, fairly high speed (compared to cyclist B) in the positive direction for about 10 seconds, ending at a fairly far in the positive direction from zero.

# Describing Motion

![bg fit right](../images/Kinematics/image.png)

#### Written description of bicyclist B:
Bicyclist B begins at a position in the positive direction from zero, and moves at a constant, fairly low speed
(compared to cyclist A) in the negative direction for about 10 seconds, ending closer to zero than its starting
position.

---

# Describing Motion 

Each description should include:
- Starting position
- Direction of motion (positive direction, no motion, or negative direction)
- Type of motion (at rest, constant velocity, speeding up, slowing down or some combination of these)
- Relative speed (slow, medium, fast, slower, faster‚Äîthis is only meaningful with there is more than
one part of the motion or when you are comparing two or more objects)
