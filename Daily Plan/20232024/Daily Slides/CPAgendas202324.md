# 2023.09.15 - **Conceptual Physics**

##### **❓of the 📅**:  Who or where would you haunt if you had to be a ghost 👻?


1. Buggy Lab Part I - *Does it move in a consistent manner*?
    i. Finish Collecting Data
    ii. Whiteboard results - make a CER statement along with your evidence
2. Buggy Lab Part II - Comparing the motion of two toy cars

# Claim - Evidence - Reasoning 

* ***Claim***:
    * Sentence that answers the question.

* ***Evidence***:
    * Explanation of how the evidence supports the claim.
        * Should include details!
        * Refer back to the question, include any data, diagrams, or graphs.

* Reasoning:
    * Physics principle, such as an equation, law, or definition.
        * This is general, do no include specific details.

# 2023.09.13 **Conceptual Physics** Agenda

##### **❓of the 📅**: Is cake 🍰 better than ice cream 🍨?


1. Whiteboard Pasta Bridge Lab:
    - Graph
    - Equation
2. Board Meeting
    - What does the slope tells us? The intercept?
3. Buggy Lab:

---

# Pasta Bridge Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
- What does the intercept mean?
    - Y-intercept: the vertical value when the horizontal value is zero.

# Lab Grouping:

## Arrange yourselves into **logical** lab groups based on the word on your index card.

### Rules:

1. Groups are based on index card
2. There are **3** total groups
3. No groups are larger than **3** members

# A Few Questions... 🤔
### Answer on your index card 


1. What do you like to be called? What Emoji describes you?	
2. The class is stranded on a deserted island. What special skill(s) can you bring to this dire situation?	
3. What is unique about you that leads to your happiest times and best performances at school?	
4. What is unique about you that allows you to work well in groups for the success of the group as a whole?	
5. What has a teacher done for you in the past which has allowed you to learn?
6. Write a motivation message to yourself about this school year

# Survival Island 🏝️

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island 😮!

Using *each* of your **unique skill's** develop a plan to escape the island.

Whiteboard your response (one person)

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
