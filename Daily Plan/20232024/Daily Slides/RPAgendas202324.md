# 2023.09.20 - **Regents Physics**

##### **❓of the 📅**:  Which of the five senses would you say is your strongest?


1. Review Buggy Lab - What did you do? How did you do it? What did you find?
2. Buggy Lab Board Meeting 
3. [Motion Definitions](../../../Presentations/APCVPM/talks/CVPM2023.html) from the Buggy Lab 
4. CER & Does it move with CV?

---

# Buggy Lab 

## **How did you do your lab? What did you find?**

### Questions to consider:

1. Does your buggy move "in a ***consistent*** manner"?
2. What does your slope represent?
    - What does a steeper slope mean?
    - What does a negative slope mean?
3. What does your vertical intercept represent?
4. Do your lines intersect? What does that tell you?
5. How could you use your results to predict the motion of your toy car?

##### **❓of the 📅**:  Does your family have a “motto” – spoken or unspoken?
1. Finish Buggy Lab Part II
2. Buggy Lab Part II - Board Meeting 
3. CER and Does it Move with CV? [Slides](../../../Presentations/APCVPM/talks/CVPM2023.html#2)

# 2023.09.15 - **Regents Physics**

##### **❓of the 📅**:  Who or where would you haunt if you had to be a ghost 👻?


1. Buggy Lab Part I - *Does it move in a consistent manner*?
    i. Finish Collecting Data
    ii. Whiteboard results - make a CER statement along with your evidence
2. Buggy lab Part II - Comparing the motion of two Buggies

# Buggy Lab 🚗 - Part II

Create a descriptive (both verbal and mathematical) model of the motion of toy cars.
    
-  How is **position** related to **time** for your toy car?
-  Remember to use starting positions on card situations
-  Take data for one car at a time
-  **Time** is your independent variable
-  Graph the motion of both cars on the SAME graph (you can add another data set to the vertical axis that goes with the

##### **❓of the 📅**:  Is cake 🍰 better than ice cream 🍨?

## 📋 Agenda

1. Board Meeting - Pasta Bridge Lab 
    - What was your question?
    - How did you do it?
    - What did you find?
2. Linear Modeling & Writing Physics Equations 
3. Buggy Lab 🚗 

---

# Linear Model


### Equation from Math Class:



$$ y = mx + b$$ 

or 

$$ y = 12x + 4$$ 

---

# The Physics Models...


* Math: $y = mx + b$


* Specific Model: $strength = (7.5\textrm{rocks/strand})strands - 12 \textrm{ rocks}$

* Generic Model: $marbles = (strength \textrm{ } ratio) strands - cup mass$

## 📋 Agenda

1. Pasta Bridge Lab - Collect Data 
2. Pasta Bridge Lab - Pivot
3. Pasta Bridge Lab - Whiteboard Results & Present 
4. Mathematical Modeling

# Pasta Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
- What does the intercept mean? Is it of value? Is it negligible?

# A Few Questions... 🤔
### Answer on your index card 


1. What do you like to be called? What Emoji describes you?	
2. The class is stranded on a deserted island. What special skill(s) can you bring to this dire situation?	
3. What is unique about you that leads to your happiest times and best performances at school?

# Survival Island 🏝️

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island 😮!

Using *each* of your **unique skill's** develop a plan to escape the island.

Whiteboard your response (one person)

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
