# Flying 🐄 🐖 🦇

The buffalo farm has recently acquired some flying animals and needs to test the length of the flying animals' leashes. The farm is trying to find a way to predict how long it takes for the animals to complete one circle while attached to their loop (in physics, we call this the "period" or time for one event of repeating events to happen and use the symbol $T$.) 

**Your goal is to predict the time it takes for your animal to take 10 swings based on the length of your animal's string.**

# Swinging Stoppers 

## 🤔 **<u>Essential Question</u>:**

## How are the **radius**, **mass**, and **tension** force related to the velocity that you swing your stopper at?

</div>

<div>

# **Notes** 📔

1. Try to swing with horizontal circles
2. Do not swing so aggressively that things will go flying 
2. When measuring **time** be sure to time for multiple swings
3. Do your best to control 2 of the three variables for each experiment

# Force of Gravity $(F_g)$ Lab 

## **Essential Question:** How is **mass** related to the force of gravity?

---

# $F_g$ Lab 

## Notes:

* $F_g = mg$
* Force of gravity on an object by the Earth (or other planet) is called ***weight***
* Weight is a **FORCE**, mass is scalar quantity
* $g$ is the gravitational field strength
    * Measured in N/kg 
    * changes based on planet and location on that planet
    * _near the surface of the Earth_ $g = 9.8 \textrm{ N/kg}$

# Spring Force Lab 

## **Essential Question:** How is the displacement (stretch) of the spring related to the spring force?

# Test Corrections


1. Determine correct answer for questions answered incorrectly
    + For FRQ you need to correct the entire part (i.e. part (a)) if you lost *any* points
    + No you cannot see what you put before - start from scratch
2. For MC questions you must provide a justification for your answers
    - Start with a fact of physics "slope of VT is acceleration" or "area of VT is displacement"
    - Draw a diagram to help (i.e. draw a VT graph)
    - Try to use a claim evidence reasoning format to write your justification
4. Finally, compare your new, correct answers to your test and determine if your mistake was one of the 4 C's: clueless, careless, conceptual, or calculation.
5. Put everything together (old test, new test, correction sheets) with a paperclip.

# Linear Model


### Equation from Math Class:



$$ y = mx + b$$ 

or 

$$ y = 12x + 4$$ 

---

# The Physics Models...


* Math: $y = mx + b$


* Specific Model: $strength = (7.5\textrm{rocks/strand})strands - 12 \textrm{ rocks}$

* Generic Model: $marbles = (strength \textrm{ } ratio) strands - cup mass$

# Pasta Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
- What does the intercept mean? Is it of value? Is it negligible?
