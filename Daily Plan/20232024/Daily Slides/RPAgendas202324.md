-  Remember to use starting positions on card situations
-  Take data for one car at a time
-  **Time** is your independent variable
-  Graph the motion of both cars on the SAME graph (you can add another data set to the vertical axis that goes with the

##### **❓of the 📅**:  Is cake 🍰 better than ice cream 🍨?

## 📋 Agenda

1. Board Meeting - Pasta Bridge Lab 
    - What was your question?
    - How did you do it?
    - What did you find?
2. Linear Modeling & Writing Physics Equations

# Linear Model


### Equation from Math Class:



$$ y = mx + b$$ 

or 

$$ y = 12x + 4$$ 

---

# The Physics Models...


* Math: $y = mx + b$


* Specific Model: $strength = (7.5\textrm{rocks/strand})strands - 12 \textrm{ rocks}$

* Generic Model: $marbles = (strength \textrm{ } ratio) strands - cup mass$

# Pasta Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
- What does the intercept mean? Is it of value? Is it negligible?
