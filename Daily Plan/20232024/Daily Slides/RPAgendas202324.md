##### **❓of the 📅**:  What smells bring you back to a different time? 👃 🌲

## 📋 Agenda

1. Pasta Bridge Lab - Collect Data 
2. Pasta Bridge Lab - Pivot
3. Pasta Bridge Lab - Whiteboard Results & Present 
4. Mathematical Modeling

# Pasta Lab

- What does the slope represent?
  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
- What does the intercept mean? Is it of value? Is it negligible?

# The Models...


* Math: $y = mx + b$


* Specific Model: $strength = (7.5\textrm{rocks/strand})strands - 12 \textrm{ rocks}$

* Generic Model: $marbles = (strength \textrm{ } ratio) strands - cup mass$

# A Few Questions... 🤔
### Answer on your index card 


1. What do you like to be called? What Emoji describes you?	
2. The class is stranded on a deserted island. What special skill(s) can you bring to this dire situation?	
3. What is unique about you that leads to your happiest times and best performances at school?	
4. What is unique about you that allows you to work well in groups for the success of the group as a whole?	
5. What has a teacher done for you in the past which has allowed you to learn?
6. Write a motivation message to yourself about this school year

# Survival Island 🏝️

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island 😮!

Using *each* of your **unique skill's** develop a plan to escape the island.

Whiteboard your response (one person)

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
