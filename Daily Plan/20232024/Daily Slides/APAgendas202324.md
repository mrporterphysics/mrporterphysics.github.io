### 2023.10.30  **AP Physics** Do Now 

A weight is tied to a rope that is wrapped around a pulley. The pulley is initially rotating counterclockwise and is pulling the weight up. The tension in the rope creates a torque on the pulley that opposes this rotation. The weight slows down, stops momentarily, and then moves back downward. Assume uniform motion. 

<div class = "columns">

<div>

1. **Graph of the angular velocity $(\omega)$ versus time for the period from the initial instant shown until the weight comes back down to the same height.** Take the initial angular velocity as positive.
2. **Graph the angular acceleration $(\alpha)$ versus time for the same time period.**

  - For every statement: "The &lt; **quantity on vertical axis** &gt; goes up &lt; **slope value with vertical units** &gt; for every 1 &lt; **horizontal unit** &gt; of &lt; **quantity on horizontal axis** &gt;."
- What does the intercept mean?

# Ball Bounce Lab - Prelab Questions 

1. What is the problem? Describe the problem or goal of your lab in your own words. Be sure that your description includes known factors (information about the problem given to you in the lab in a problem statement, for example) and unknowns (what you need to find out to solve the problem). Then restate the problem in the form of a question or questions that will guide your research.

2. What do you know about the science of the problem that could help you answer your research question? 

---

# Ball Bounce Lab - Prelab Questions 

3. What is your hypothesis for the answer to your research question?

--- 

# Ball Bounce Lab - Prelab Questions 

4. What variables can you use to test your hypothesis? (Independent, dependent, control)

---


# Ball Bounce Lab - Prelab Questions 

5. What experiment(s) could you use to test your hypothesis? Referring to the list of variables, brainstorm some experiments you could do that would allow you to manipulate variables so that you can make the measurements or observations necessary for testing the hypothesis. Briefly list the materials and outline the methods you will use for your experiment.

---

# Ball Bounce Lab 

1. Carry out your experiment 
2. Answer Post Lab Questions 
3. On your whiteboard board communicate your results 

---

# Ball Bounce Lab - Post Lab, Models 

## What can you do with your results? 

## Do you results model a ball bounce?

## Can you use your results to make a **prediction**? If so, use your model to make a prediction with a value *outside* of your data set.

# Lab Grouping:

## Arrange yourselves into **logical** lab groups based on the word on your index card.

### Rules:

1. Groups are based on index card
2. There are **6** total groups
3. No groups are larger than **4** members

* You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That‚Äôs okay. 
* Physics is hard to understand until you know the ‚Äúrules of the game.‚Äù
* But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don‚Äôt understand.
* However, remember that you didn‚Äôt always understand.
* When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù, you are excited.
* The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we‚Äôre all here to support each other on our journeys.
* Being told the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù at most gives you one answer that you didn‚Äôt know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.

# A Few Questions... ü§î
### Answer on your index card 


1. What do you like to be called?	
2. The class is stranded on a deserted island. What special skill(s) can you bring to this dire situation?	
3. What is unique about you that leads to your happiest times and best performances at school?	
4. What is unique about you that allows you to work well in groups for the success of the group as a whole?	
5. What has a teacher done for you in the past which has allowed you to learn?
6. Write a motivation message to yourself about this school year

# Survival Island üèùÔ∏è

You and your group are stranded on an deserted island üòÆ!

Using *each* of your **unique skill's** develop a plan to escape the island.

Whiteboard your response (one person)

Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.

# Pivot Interactives 

- Join class in Canvas 
- Only one person from group needs to submit *this* assignment. (Note: not all labs will be this way -- today's focus is working in a group).
