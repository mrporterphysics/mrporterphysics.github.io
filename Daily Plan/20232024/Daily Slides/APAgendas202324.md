### 2024.02.29 **AP Physics** Do Now 

<div class='columns'>

<div>

A block of mass $M$ is released from rest at point 1, as shown in the figure. The block slides without frictional forces along the circular arc but encounters frictional forces as soon as it reaches the horizontal portion of the track at point 2. The block travels a distance $D$ along the horizontal track before coming to rest at point 3. Consider the block-Earth system. In terms of the mechanical energy of the system, which of the following claims is correct, and why?

</div>

<div>

![center w:400](../images/energy/blockcurvedramp.png)

1. The system is open, because there is a net force exerted on the block.
2. The system is open, because the block’s velocity is zero at points 1 and 3.
3. The system is closed, because there is a net force exerted on the block.
4. The system is closed, because the block’s velocity is 0 at points 1 and 3.

</div>

### 2024.02.29 **AP Physics** Do Now 2

An object is released from rest at a height $H$ near and above the surface of Earth. As the object falls toward the surface, Earth’s atmosphere exerts a resistive force on the object such that it reaches a terminal velocity before it reaches the ground. Which of the following claims is true? Select two answers.

1. The system consisting of only the object is an open system.
2. Earth’s atmosphere does negative work on the object as it falls toward the surface.
3. The change in the object’s kinetic energy from the instant it is released from rest, to the instant it reaches terminal velocity, is zero.
4. The total mechanical energy of the object-Earth system remains constant at all times in which the object is in motion.

# Flying 🐄 🐖 🦇

The buffalo farm has recently acquired some flying animals and needs to test the length of the flying animals' leashes. The farm is trying to find a way to predict how long it takes for the animals to complete one circle while attached to their loop (in physics, we call this the "period" or time for one event of repeating events to happen and use the symbol $T$.) 

**Your goal is to predict the time it takes for your animal to take 10 swings based on the length of your animal's string.**

A student conducts an experiment in which a $0.5 \textrm{ kg}$ ball is spun in a vertical circle from a string of length $1 \textrm{ m}$, as shown in the figure. The student uses the following equation to predict the force of tension exerted on the ball whenever it reaches the lowest point of its circular path at a known tangential speed for various trials.

$$ F_{Tension} = m \frac{v^2}{r}$$

When the experiment is conducted, the student uses a force probe to measure the actual force of tension exerted on the ball. Why is the predicted force of tension different than the actual force of tension?

A person pushes a large block on a horizontal ice surface in a straight line to the right with constant speed, as shown above. The mass of the block is and frictional forces between the block and the ice are negligible. However, the block has a wide cross-sectional area such that air resistance acting on the block cannot be neglected. The opposite is true for the person: air resistance on the person is negligible, but the person’s shoes do not slip on the ice. The table shows the force exerted by the person on the block for several values of constant speed.

1. A student claims that the data show that the magnitude of the force of air resistance is proportional to the speed of the object, within experimental uncertainty. Use physics principles to explain whether the claim is correct.
2. As the person pushes the block, the person moves with the same constant speed as the block. Consider the scenario in which the person’s speed is 5.00 m/s. Draw and label the forces (not components) exerted on the person. Each force must be represented by a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing away from, the dot.


</div>

<div>

| ---- | ---- |
| 20 | 1.25 |
| 40 | 2.51 |
| 60 | 3.73 |
| 80 | 5.00 |

3. The person now stops and releases the block. Determine the magnitude and direction of the block’s acceleration at the instant the block is released. (For scenario in which the person's speed is 5.00 m/s.)

### 2023.12.19 **AP Physics** Do Now 

A person pulls a block across a rough horizontal surface at a constant speed by applying a force F at a slight angle as shown. A free-body diagram is drawn for the block. The arrows in the diagram correctly indicate the directions but not necessarily the magnitudes of the various forces on the block. A student makes the following claim about this free-body diagram:

_"The velocity of the block is constant, so the net force acting on the block must be zero. Thus the normal force $F_N$ equals the weight $W$, and the force of friction $f_k$ equals the applied force $F$."_

**What, if anything, is wrong with this statement?**

## Porter Notes 📋

- Why the velocity columns? What velocity are you recording? Initial? Final? Average?
    - We are looking at the **acceleration** of the cart -- can find with *slope* of the VT graphs
- You will need to separate out your data from **each fan setting** (i.e. an acceleration column for each fan setting)
    - You can fix this by downloading the data and manipulating in Google Sheets with copy and paste
- Groups with zero acceleration? We will need to discuss whats happening there (if you have zero acceleration forces are balanced and fan isn't working?)
- You ***must include*** the *cart's mass* in your mass column

    - Start with a fact of physics "slope of VT is acceleration" or "area of VT is displacement"
    - Draw a diagram to help (i.e. draw a VT graph)
    - Try to use a claim evidence reasoning format to write your justification

The first ball (a through f) rolls with constant velocity across a horizontal surface, while the second ball (g through l) rolls with constant acceleration down an inclined ramp. Both objects are at position zero at time = 0, and both are at position = d at time = 6 s.

### As a space shuttle burns up its fuel after take-off, it gets lighter and lighter and its acceleration larger and larger. Between the moment it takes off and the time at which it has consumed nearly all of its fuel, is the magnitude of the average velocity larger than, equal to, or smaller than half its final speed? 

### In a clear, paragraph-length response, explain why. [Hint: you can draw a diagram and refer to it in your paragraph. (Maybe a velocity-time graph would help you visualize this answer)]


---

## Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

#### ABCD: ***Answer***, Basic Physics, Cite information, Draw it together

**Answer the Question** (Claim)

* DO: State whether something increases, decreases, or stays the same.
  - If given two or more cases to choose from, state which case answers the question, or clearly state that both cases are the same.
* DON'T: Just say that something “changes”. We need to know how it changes. Talk about how it could be either case or both. You need to commit to an answer.

---

## Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

#### ABCD: Answer, ***Basic Physics***, Cite information, Draw it together

**Basic Physics** (Evidence)

* Your explanation needs to include at least one statement of basic physics. You'll know that this is a statement of basic physics because a statement of basic physics is true all the time, every day, and in all situations. Basic physics can be the name of a law of physics, like "Newton’s Third Law", or it can be a statement of the law itself, such as "when the horse pulls the cart, the cart pulls back on the horse with the same force."

---

## Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

#### ABCD: Answer, Basic Physics, ***Cite information***, Draw it together


**Cite Important Information** (Evidence)

* This is when you point out important aspects of this particular situation that are relevant to your explanation. The Cite Information sentence should start with the words “in this situation” or “in Case 1” or “for the small cart, ...” and proceed to say something about the particular problem you are presented with.

--- 

## Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

#### ABCD: Answer, Basic Physics, Cite information, ***Draw it together***

**Draw It All Together** (Reasoning)

* This is when you take your statements of basic physics and the important information that you cited from this situation and show how it logically leads to the correct answer. Depending on how well you do your B’s and C’s, your “Draw it Together” might only be a single sentence.

---

## More Tips for Paragraph Length Response:

* Do NOT use "it", "they", "them". Use good nouns (you know the words on your reference table)
* Use good verbs that talk about what the nouns are doing
  - (Objects will speed up, slow down, change direction, gain/lose/transfer energy, gain/lose/transfer momentum, exert or experience forces, etc.)
* You do not need to restate the question.
* Don't write more than you mean to
* Don't write just "force" - state the specific force
* Don't write "it moves"!!

# The Physics Models...


* Math: $y = mx + b$


* Specific Model: $strength = (7.5\textrm{rocks/strand})strands - 12 \textrm{ rocks}$

* Generic Model: $marbles = (strength \textrm{ } ratio) strands - cup mass$ 

* Specific Model: $bounce = (0.4 \textrm{cm/cm})drop + 4 \textrm{ cm}$ 

* Generic Model: $b_h = r  d_h + d_{ball}$

# Lab Grouping:

## Arrange yourselves into **logical** lab groups based on the word on your index card.

### Rules:

1. Groups are based on index card
2. There are **6** total groups
3. No groups are larger than **4** members

* You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That’s okay. 
* Physics is hard to understand until you know the “rules of the game.”
* But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don’t understand.
* However, remember that you didn’t always understand.
* When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the “answer”, you are excited.
* The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we’re all here to support each other on our journeys.
* Being told the “answer” at most gives you one answer that you didn’t know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.
