# Linear Model



### Equation from Math Class:



$$ y = mx + b$$ 

or 

$$ y = 12x + 4$$ 

---

# The Physics Models...


* Math: $y = mx + b$


* Specific Model: $strength = (7.5\textrm{rocks/strand})strands - 12 \textrm{ rocks}$

* Generic Model: $marbles = (strength \textrm{ } ratio) strands - cup mass$ 

* Specific Model: $bounce = (0.4 \textrm{cm/cm})drop + 4 \textrm{ cm}$ 

* Generic Model: $b_h = r  d_h + d_{ball}$

# Ball Bounce Lab - Prelab Questions 

1. What is the problem? Describe the problem or goal of your lab in your own words. Be sure that your description includes known factors (information about the problem given to you in the lab in a problem statement, for example) and unknowns (what you need to find out to solve the problem). Then restate the problem in the form of a question or questions that will guide your research.

# Lab Grouping:

## Arrange yourselves into **logical** lab groups based on the word on your index card.

### Rules:

1. Groups are based on index card
2. There are **6** total groups
3. No groups are larger than **4** members

# **Why?** <br> What connection does <br> this  grouping "game" <br> have to physics class? <!---fit--->

* You may feel frustrated as you try to figure physics out. That’s okay. 
* Physics is hard to understand until you know the “rules of the game.”
* But, once you discover the rules, physics often seems easy and you may be surprised that others don’t understand.
* However, remember that you didn’t always understand.
* When you discover the rules and understand without someone just telling you the “answer”, you are excited.
* The journey to understanding is very important. So, no one is going to tell you the answer, but we’re all here to support each other on our journeys.
* Being told the “answer” at most gives you one answer that you didn’t know. Learning to think critically and arrive at the answer with support develops a skill that you will use to find many answers.
