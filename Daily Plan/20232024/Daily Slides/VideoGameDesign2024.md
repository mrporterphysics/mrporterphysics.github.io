- 1 Harbor Card 
- 10 River Cards

<div>



## Game Prep

Place the harbour card (goal) and the 10 River cards on the table, following the exact order shown on the bottom of the game box.

Each player chooses a colour and takes all three boats of that colour. All players' boats begin the game on the fourth river card from the bottom.

# Up the River 


## Game rules

The youngest player may begin. Play proceeds in a clockwise direction. 

On your turn, roll the die and sail one of your boats toward the harbour for as many river cards as the number thrown. Unless you roll a 6! 

---

# Up The River 

### Sandbank card

Every boat runs aground on the sandbank. Even though the number you roll might otherwise let you sail on, your turn ends here.
On your next turn you may roll again and move on.

### High tide card

If you land on the card with waves on a direct throw, this means the tide is in your favour and you may advance three more spaces or cards.

# Up The River 

## Rolling a 6... 

...can either mean a good wind for your fleet or an ill one for your opponents. You have two choices:


#### Option 1 - A Good Wind. 

If you roll a 6, you may move any one of your boats up to join the next one of your boats farther up the river. (Your third boat in play may move to the same river card as the second; or the second may move to the same river card as the first) If the sandbank is in the way, however, you must stop there. If you have only one boat left on the river, or if all three boats are already on the same card, you may not use this option.

## Rolling a 6... 

### Option 2 - An Ill Wind. 

If you roll a 6 and cannot or do not choose the Good Wind Option, you may take one of your opponents' boats and move it back to the nearest boat of the same colour. It does not have to stop at the sandbank. If there is only one boat of a given colour on the river, or if all three of one colour are on the same river card, you may not use this option. If you cannot use either the Good or the Ill Wind, you lose your turn.

# Up the River 

## The Waterfall

Now comes the really exciting part! Each player rolls the die and moves one of his or her boats. When it's the first player's turn again, the tide changes.

If you are the first player, each time it is your turn, take the bottom (farthest from the harbour) river card and move it to the top (closest to the harbour). If there are any boats on the bottom card they fall over the waterfall and are out of the game.

If you lose all your boats over the waterfall you are out of the game. Better luck next time!

# Up the River 

## To enter the harbour

You do not need a direct throw to reach the harbour (if, for example, you are 2 spaces away and roll a 3 you may enter).

Once you reach the harbour, you will want to tie up your boat at the dock with the highest number (point value). For example, the first boat to enter the harbour will always dock at number 12, the second at 11, and so forth. There can be only one boat at each dock.

---

# Up the River 

## End of the game

The game is over when all boats have either gone over the waterfall or reached the harbour. Each player adds up the numbers on his or her docks, and the player with the highest score wins.
