## Game Prep

Place the harbour card (goal) and the 10 River cards on the table, following the exact order shown on the bottom of the game box.

the bottom.

## Game rules

The youngest player may begin. Play proceeds in a clockwise direction.
On your turn, roll the die and sail one of your boats toward the harbour for as many river cards as the number thrown. Unless you
roll a 6! 

## Sandbank card

Every boat runs aground on the sandbank. Even though the number you roll might otherwise let you sail on, your turn ends here.
On your next turn you may roll again and move on.
