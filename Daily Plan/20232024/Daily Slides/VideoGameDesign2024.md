# What is a **game**? <!--fit--->

---

# A Game...

## is a **play activity** with **rules** that involve **conflict**

---

# **Critical** Vocabulary

- **Critical** means we are analyzing games by carefully considering all of their parts and how they fit together. 
    * NOT that we are trying to find fault!

---

# 🤔 Ideas about Games 

* A game has *ends and means*: an objective, outcome, and set of rules
* A game is an activity that involving player decisions, seeking objectives, withing a *limiting context* 
* A game is a ***voluntary effort to overcome unnecessary obstacles***

...and many more

---

# Games 🧩

* Games are an activity
* Games have rules 
* Games have conflict 
* Games have goals 
* Games invovle decision making
* Games are artifical, they are safe, they are outside ordinary life
* Games and voluntary
* Games have uncertain outcomes 

---

# Games 🧩

* Games are a representation or simulation of something real, but they are themselves make believe.
* Games are inefficient. The rules impose obstacles that prevent the player from reaching their goal through the most efficient means.
* Games have systems. Usually closed systems
* Games are a form of art

---

# Board Game **Genres**

1. Research Board games and come up with a list of board game genres. 
2. Create a list of genres and their descriptions
3. Make a list of **games you've played** for each genre

# Learn your **stuff** <!--fit--->

## Theme and aesthetics driven approach <!--fit--->

### What is the core idea that drives your game forward?


<!--- Notes:

Space Captain theme 

- Read and watch science fiction
- What are the categories? Leadership, exploration, science-technology, strategy
- What are elements of the experience? movement, attack and defense, resources?

# Sythesizing Information 

- Categorize:
    - Aesthetics 
    - Thematic Elements 
    - Mechanics 
    - Components 


---

# Visual **Aesthetics** <!--fit--->

---

# Themetic Elements

What elements define the theme and genre. Not only looks but also situations, characters, emotions and actions. Everything that defines the theme, even if it’s not going to be featured in the game, like music or smells.


---

# Mechanics

Looking at mechanics of other games 

(Mechanics - how the game functions, rules, moves, physical space, etc)

---

# Components 

- Board
- Pieces
- Driven by the visual aesthetics, theme, and mechanics 

---

# Defining the **Game** and its **Scope** <!--fit--->

---

# Define:

- Purpose of the game
- The player 
- Design Principles 
- Scope of the Game
- Constraints 

---

# Purpose 

## Why are you making this game?

**Start with your purose**

---

# Design Principles 

## Your guidelines or "rules" that define your intent and strategy

Principle: "Has to be enjoyable"

1. Depth of complexity 
2. Simplicity over strict rules
3. Avoid rigid narratives 
4. The best strategist should win

---

# The Player - your audience

- Age
- Interests 
- Motivations 
- Habits 

Who will enjoy your game?

--- 

# Scope and Constraints

- Complexity
- Production & Costs 

---

# Requirements and Constraints 

Requirements: Hard limits, usually imposed by publisher or manufacturing

Constraints: Soft limits, designs self-impose - i.e. card game, limit to 20 cards 

--- 

# A Game is a System 

## Three Core Elements 

### Mechanics (rules & technology & physicality)

### Dynamics (choices, actions during the game)

### Aesthemtics (emotional connection)

---

> A board game is all about creating interesting choices for the players. 

---

# Mechanics **create** the Dynamics <!--fit--->

- Mechanics are the rules and inner workings of the game as a system. 
- Dynamics are how the game is played, the mechanics create the dynamics
- Aestheics are how the game is felt, how do the players feel based on their dynamics 

---

# Conceptualization 

At the beginning of the conceptualization phase what we want to do is to take all the thematic elements we’ve identified previously and translate them to mechanics.

# Deconstructing your Game 

## On a whiteboard with your group

<div class='columns'>

<div>

Theme based

1. Theme
2. What experience is the game trying to create?
3. What are the mechanics of the game?
3. What are the dynamics?
4. What are the aesthetics?

OR...reverse engineering

1. How did the game make you feel (aesthetics)
2. What dynamics made you feel that way?
3. What mechanics created that game?
3. What experience was created?
4. How does this fit the theme?

# Up the River 🦆

<div class='columns'>
<div>

## Contents: 

- 1 Harbor Card 
- 10 River Cards
- 12 Sailboats (3 per 4 col)
- 1 six-sided die

## Object of the game

Each player tries to get all three of his or her boats into the harbour and to earn the most points for each boat.

</div>
<div>



## Game Prep

Place the harbour card (goal) and the 10 River cards on the table, following the exact order shown on the bottom of the game box.

Each player chooses a colour and takes all three boats of that colour. All players' boats begin the game on the fourth river card from the bottom.


</div>

</div>

---

# Up the River 


## Game rules

The youngest player may begin. Play proceeds in a clockwise direction. 

On your turn, roll the die and sail one of your boats toward the harbour for as many river cards as the number thrown. Unless you roll a 6! 

---

# Up The River 

### Sandbank card

Every boat runs aground on the sandbank. Even though the number you roll might otherwise let you sail on, your turn ends here.
On your next turn you may roll again and move on.

### High tide card

If you land on the card with waves on a direct throw, this means the tide is in your favour and you may advance three more spaces or cards.

---

# Up The River 

## Rolling a 6... 

...can either mean a good wind for your fleet or an ill one for your opponents. You have two choices:


#### Option 1 - A Good Wind. 

If you roll a 6, you may move any one of your boats up to join the next one of your boats farther up the river. (Your third boat in play may move to the same river card as the second; or the second may move to the same river card as the first) If the sandbank is in the way, however, you must stop there. If you have only one boat left on the river, or if all three boats are already on the same card, you may not use this option.

---

# Up The River 

## Rolling a 6... 

### Option 2 - An Ill Wind. 

If you roll a 6 and cannot or do not choose the Good Wind Option, you may take one of your opponents' boats and move it back to the nearest boat of the same colour. It does not have to stop at the sandbank. If there is only one boat of a given colour on the river, or if all three of one colour are on the same river card, you may not use this option. If you cannot use either the Good or the Ill Wind, you lose your turn.

---

# Up the River 

## The Waterfall

Now comes the really exciting part! Each player rolls the die and moves one of his or her boats. When it's the first player's turn again, the tide changes.

If you are the first player, each time it is your turn, take the bottom (farthest from the harbour) river card and move it to the top (closest to the harbour). If there are any boats on the bottom card they fall over the waterfall and are out of the game.

If you lose all your boats over the waterfall you are out of the game. Better luck next time!

---

# Up the River 

## To enter the harbour

You do not need a direct throw to reach the harbour (if, for example, you are 2 spaces away and roll a 3 you may enter).

Once you reach the harbour, you will want to tie up your boat at the dock with the highest number (point value). For example, the first boat to enter the harbour will always dock at number 12, the second at 11, and so forth. There can be only one boat at each dock.

---

# Up the River 

## End of the game

The game is over when all boats have either gone over the waterfall or reached the harbour. Each player adds up the numbers on his or her docks, and the player with the highest score wins.
