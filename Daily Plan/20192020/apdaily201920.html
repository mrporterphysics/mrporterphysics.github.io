##2019.09.16 AP Physics

QotD: What animal would you want for a non-traditional pet? (i.e. not a dog, fish or cat)

1. Do Now - on half sheet of paper
  - What is a model?
  - What does it mean for something to move with a *constant velocity*?
  - What is velocity?
2. Dorothy and Toto
3. CER and is it constant velocity? What is a particle model?
4. Motion Maps and Multiple Representations

HW:

- Visit MHHS AP Physics Training Site, start your practice

---

class:center, middle

#Exit Ticket:

Write down an example of motion that results in a difference between displacement and distance. Add a drawing if it helps support your example.

##2019.09.13 AP Physics
###Friday the 13th...

QotD: What skill or talent do you most want to learn?

1. Welcome to Miss Sweet! She is a teacher candidate from Siena College, will be observing in the fall and teaching with me in the spring
1. Do Now - Take 5 minutes to discuss with your group:
  - What do the slope and intercept of your graph represent?
  - Did you write your equation for math class or for physics class?
  - How does your graph model the motion of your buggy?
  - Develop an argument for the following question: "Does your buggy move in a *consistent manner*?" Be sure to support your argument with evidence from your experiment.
2. CVPM - What is it?
3. Does it move with CV?
4. Motion Maps

---

##2019.09.12 AP Physics

1. Do Now:
  - Hand in safety and AP contracts
  - QotD: What slang are you really happy went out of fashion?
2. Buggy Lab:
  - Gather materials
  - Get buggy (don't forget to record which buggy you have)
  - Help place down 50 meter measuring tape
  - Collect Data
3. Make whiteboard
4. Board meeting:
  - Do the buggies move *in a consistent manner*?
  - What conclusions can we draw about modeling the motion of these buggies?
5. Defining location and change in location
6. Multiple Representations

HW: Discussion and Conclusion in Pivot

---

##2019.09.10 AP Physics

1. Do Now:
  - Pick up safety contract and AP contract
  - Write down on a piece of paper: What are two important things to consider when designing and experiment?

2. Introductory Science Skills and Linear Modeling
3. Write conclusion for Pasta Bridge Lab
4. Buggy Lab


HW:

- Signed AP Contract
- Signed Safety Contract

##2019.09.06 AP Physics

###Pasta Bridge Lab

The goal for this lab is to design an experiment to discover the relationship between strands of pasta and the number of pebbles that it can hold. Design an experiment that will allow you to find your relationship.
--


Please Note

- Make sure someone is prepared to catch the cup
- Make a marking on your cup so you can reuse it if needed
- Throw out pasta in trash after they break


---

##2019.09.06 AP Physics

###End of Class To Do:

- Save Pivot
-  Clean up area, mark the cup you are using (so you use the same cup next time)
  - is there anything else you need to measure to start taking data again tomorrow? (i.e. chair distance, chair orientation, etc)
- Erase whiteboard and return whiteboard markers
- Answer question on Google Classroom
- Hand in survival paper (questionnaire) in bin on laptop cart
