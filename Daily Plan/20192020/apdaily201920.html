#Do Now:

A satellite is in circular orbit around an unknown planet. The satellite has a speed of 64 km/s, and the radius of its orbit (measured from the center of the planet) is 2,100 km. A second, identical satellite also has a circular orbit around this same planet, of radius 8,400 km.

Two students are discussing how the speed of the second satellite might be calculated:

Luis says, "*the speed of the second satellite cannot be determined. We need to know the mass of the satellites and the unknown planet.*"

Marsha says, "*but the mass of the unknown planet can be calculated with Newton's law of universal gravitation with the speed and radius of the first satellite. We have to do that first, but then we can calculate the speed of the second satellite.*"

##3.D Vertical Circles

What happens to the tension at the top of the circle when the ball has its minimum speed to complete the circular path?

--

`\(\Sigma F = \frac{mv^2}{r}\)` Centripetal acceleration can be represented by the velocity squared over the radius

--

`\(F_g - F_T = \frac{mv^2}{r}\)` The centripetal force is the sum of the radial forces, gravity and tension

--

`\(mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}\)` At the minimum speed the tension approaches zero.

--

`\(v = \sqrt{gr}\)` Mass cancels and the equation is solved for velocity


---

##3.D Vertical Circles


--

###Extensions

--

Why is the tenion greater at the bottom of the circle than it is at the top of the circle?

--

###Extension

If the string was cut at Point `\(Q\)` (which is a height `\(L\)` above the ground) when the ball has a speed `\(v\)`, sketch the path the ball takes before it hits the ground. Derive an expression for the time the ball takes to hit the ground.

---

##3.E Max Speed over the Top

Prior to answering the question:

Assume the car takes multiple trips over the hill. Each trip the car increases its speed. Describe what happens to the normal force as the speed of the car increases. Why does this happen?

--

Hint: pick the direction of acceleration as the positive direction.

--
What does it mean to be weightless?

---

##3.E Extension - Whiteboard:

*A roller coaster approaches the first loop de loop. Draw a free-body
diagram of one of the coaster cars when it is at the top of the first loop.
Starting with Newton’s second law, derive an expression for the minimum
speed of the car without it losing contact with the track. When the car
was on top of the hill, the same expression was derived for the maximum
speed. In a few short sentences, explain how the same expression can
represent both the minimum and maximum speed.*

---

##3.F Horizontal Circles

An object of mass `\(m\)` moves on a curved path from point `\(X\)` to point `\(Y\)`.
Which of the following diagrams indicates a possible combination of the
net force `\(F\)`, exerted on the object, the velocity `\(v\)`, and the acceleration `\(a\)` of
the object at the location shown.

The figures below show systems containing a block initially held at rest on a frictionless surface. In each system, the block is attached to the end of a spring, which is stretched to the right. The mass and spring constant are given for each system, as well as the distance the spring is initially stretched. When the mass is released, the spring will accelerate the block.


.center[<img src="../20192020/images/Springrank.jpg" width = "700 px"/>]

**Rank these systems based on the magnitude of the spring force applied on the blocks from greatest to least.**

***Explain your reasoning***

Three students are discussing the <u>displacements</u> of the objects for the interval.

**Apriel**: *"I think the Object 2 will have the greater displacement because it gets to a higher speed faster than Object 1."*

**Brody**: *"Object 1 spends most of its time speeding up, but object 2 spends most of its time slowing down. Object 1 will go further."*

**Cyril**: *"The displacement is found from the area of the velocity graphs. But in this case we don't know the initial position that we need to add to the area. We don't have enough information to find the displacement."*

###Quiz: IPS 1. and CVPM 1.

IPS 1. I can justify and apply mathematical routines to solve problems

CVPM 1. I can express the motion of an object with constant velocity using narrative, mathematical, and graphical representations.

####Question 1:

.center[<img src="../20192020/images/quizxt1.PNG" width = "450 px"/><img src="../20192020/images/quiz1mm1.png" width = "600 px"/>]

**Narrative**: Car is at position x = 2 meters for 2 seconds before it moves at a constant speed in the positive direction of 8/3 m/s for 3 seconds. At time 5 seconds the car stops for a second and then moves in the negative direction at a constant speed of 10 m/s. Immediately at 7 seconds the car travels at a new speed of 1 m/s in the negative direction.

##2019.09.18 AP Physics


1. Do Now: Create a position time graph of Mr. Porter's adventures in the hallway this morning. Assume the hallway is 1 dimensional, `\(t=0\)` seconds is when Mr. Porter leaves his classroom door, `\(x = 0\)` is Mr. Porter's classroom door, and towards the office is the negative direction.
  - *Mr. Porter leaves his classroom and **hurries** to the bathroom. After leaving the bathroom he **casually** walks towards the copier on the first floor (just past Mr. Smith's room on the left hand side). Before he gets to the copier, he stops to listen to a few Baconisms, and continues on his way. Mr. Porter makes his copies and then **rushes** back to his classroom to beat the bell.*

QotD: What food do you love that a lot of people might find a little odd?

###Pasta Bridge Lab

The goal for this lab is to design an experiment to discover the relationship between strands of pasta and the number of pebbles that it can hold. Design an experiment that will allow you to find your relationship.

Please Note

- Make sure someone is prepared to catch the cup
- Make a marking on your cup so you can reuse it if needed
- Throw out pasta in trash after they break

##2019.09.06 AP Physics

###End of Class To Do:

- Save Pivot
-  Clean up area, mark the cup you are using (so you use the same cup next time)
  - is there anything else you need to measure to start taking data again tomorrow? (i.e. chair distance, chair orientation, etc)
- Erase whiteboard and return whiteboard markers
- Answer question on Google Classroom
- Hand in survival paper (questionnaire) in bin on laptop cart
