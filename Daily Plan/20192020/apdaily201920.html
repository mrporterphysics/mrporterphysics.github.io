####Question 1:

.center[<img src="../20192020/images/quizxt1.PNG" width = "450 px"/><img src="../20192020/images/quiz1mm1.png" width = "600 px"/>]

**Narrative**: Car is at position x = 2 meters for 2 seconds before it moves at a constant speed in the positive direction of 8/3 m/s for 3 seconds. At time 5 seconds the car stops for a second and then moves in the negative direction at a constant speed of 10 m/s. Immediately at 7 seconds the car travels at a new speed of 1 m/s in the negative direction.

##2019.09.18 AP Physics


1. Do Now: Create a position time graph of Mr. Porter's adventures in the hallway this morning. Assume the hallway is 1 dimensional, `\(t=0\)` seconds is when Mr. Porter leaves his classroom door, `\(x = 0\)` is Mr. Porter's classroom door, and towards the office is the negative direction.
  - *Mr. Porter leaves his classroom and **hurries** to the bathroom. After leaving the bathroom he **casually** walks towards the copier on the first floor (just past Mr. Smith's room on the left hand side). Before he gets to the copier, he stops to listen to a few Baconisms, and continues on his way. Mr. Porter makes his copies and then **rushes** back to his classroom to beat the bell.*

QotD: What food do you love that a lot of people might find a little odd?

###Pasta Bridge Lab

The goal for this lab is to design an experiment to discover the relationship between strands of pasta and the number of pebbles that it can hold. Design an experiment that will allow you to find your relationship.
--


Please Note

- Make sure someone is prepared to catch the cup
- Make a marking on your cup so you can reuse it if needed
- Throw out pasta in trash after they break


---

##2019.09.06 AP Physics

###End of Class To Do:

- Save Pivot
-  Clean up area, mark the cup you are using (so you use the same cup next time)
  - is there anything else you need to measure to start taking data again tomorrow? (i.e. chair distance, chair orientation, etc)
- Erase whiteboard and return whiteboard markers
- Answer question on Google Classroom
- Hand in survival paper (questionnaire) in bin on laptop cart
