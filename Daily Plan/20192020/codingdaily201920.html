#2019.10.18 Coding

QotD: If you go to any concert this weekend who would you see.

1. Wallpaper project mini project:
  - You recently have been hired by Microsoft’s design team to create 2 new wallpapers for their new line laptops. In order to boost sales and reach out to many different audiences, Microsoft would like these wallpapers to have some different color themes and use repetition. Be as creative and original as possible!

---

#Task

Create 2 variations of a desktop background using repeated elements. The design should be easily altered by changing the values in the for loop to create variations in the design.

---

#Requirements


1. Your canvas size should be (800 x 450)
1. The program should include at least one for loop.
1. The for loop(s) should be used to increment values such as width, height, or color.
1. Variations should result from changing different values in the loop. Tthe designs should not only vary in color. Play with size, number of repetitions etc.
1. Save three different variations of the same design.

---

#Examples

.center[<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_3/1.6/red.png" width = "800 px"/>]


.center[<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_3/1.6/multicolor.png" width = "800 px"/>]

---

#Extensions

Randomize your wallpaper! Use the `random()` function to generate variations of your wallpaper.

.center[<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_3/1.6/first.gif" width = "500 px"/><img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_3/1.6/second.gif" width = "500 px"/>]



---

##Task:

Draw five circles on a horizontal line, 100 pixels apart from each other.

---

###Now Draw them 50 pixels apart...

--

###Easy? Or tedious?

--

###There has to be a better way.

---

#Loops

##How we tell the computer to repeat itself, but change one aspect each time.

--

Look at your code for the 5 circles. What was similar and what was different about each line?

--

How could we simplify this code?

---

#Loops

1. Start at 100
--

2. If we haven't reached the edge of the screen
--

  - Draw ellipse
--

  - Move 100px to the right


---

#The Code

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#Three Steps For A While Loop

1. We declare and initialize a variable. Initializing a variable is setting the initial value for that variable, or where you want it to start. In this case, we would like to it begin at 100 pixels.
2. We check whether it meets a condition. The condition is inside the parentheses. We want to execute the code in the brackets on condition that x is still less than the width of the canvas.
3. We change the value of that variable in a way that will eventually make it meet the condition. In the code below, 100 is added to x inside the brackets. Every time the code is run x will increase by 100 until it's value is larger than the width of the canvas. Then the loop will be completed and the program will move on in the code.

---

#1. Initialize Variable

```javascript

*var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#2. Check Condition

```javascript

var x = 100;
*while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#Do the stuff

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
* ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#3. Iterate Variable

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
* x = x + 100;
}

```

##`for()` Loop

```javascript

for (var x = 100; x < width; x = x + 100){
  ellipse(x, 60, 40, 40);
}

```

##vs. `while()` Loop

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}
```

function draw( ){
	background(220);
	//create a row of ellipse
	for(x=10;width > x;x=x+20){
		ellipse(x,10,15,15)
	}
	//create a column with x value 10 since the row begins with that x value
	for(y=10;height > y;y=y+20){
		ellipse(10,y,15,15)
	}
	//create a column with x value 30 since the next ellipse in the row was incremented by 20
	for(y=10;height > y;y=y+20){
		ellipse(30,y,15,15)
	}
	//create a column with x value 50 since the next ellipse in the row was incremented by 20
	for(y=10;height > y;y=y+20){
		ellipse(50,y,15,15)
	}
	//create a column with x value 70 since the next ellipse in the row was incremented by 20
	for(y=10;height > y;y=y+20){
		ellipse(70,y,15,15)
	}

#2019.10.03 Coding

QotD: What weird quirks did you pick up from your parents?

1. Play each other's light switch challenge -- rotate around the room
2. Drawing with the mouse
3. Key Presses

---

**Prompt**

Remember the days of Microsoft Paint? When you could click a start bar, open a program that came preloaded on the computer, and just create? Those days were good. Those days were simple. Those days were internet free and possibly came with very little in the way of design sense.

We are better today; we have the tools needed to build our very own, p5 Microsoft Paint that looks better than ever before. And so that’s what we are going to do!

**Requirements**:

1. Create a program that allows you to draw with the mouse.
2. Create at least 4 buttons that will control different aspects of the program, such as color changes.
1. Create at least 4 key press reactions that will control different aspects of the program, such as brush type.
1. Make sure the user understands how to use your program!

**Writing Prompt**: Write a sales pitch for your program that includes instructions on how to use it and persuasive reasoning behind why you made your specific design choices.

---

**Extensions**

Level 1:
- Meets Requirements.

Level 2:
- At least 5 buttons.
- Create a drawing pen using the mouse ONLY when the mouse is being pressed
- Have one button be a random color

Level 3:
- Make an eraser
- Make a way to clear the canvas
- Make complex brush types, beyond just drawing with different shapes
- Create a website to house your creation

##Work on Light Switch Game

---

#2019.09.25 Coding

1. `dist()` function
2. `mouseIsPressed` and buttons
3. Light Switch Game:

---

class: photoback
background-image: url('https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_2/2.3/image3.gif')

Congratulations! Your great aunt’s second cousin twice removed (on your mother’s side) has recently left you a spooky old house. This is great, because “free house”. As you can imagine, however, this does come with its fair share of problems, because spooky, and old.

The biggest problem your great aunt’s second cousin twice removed’s attorney warns you about when handing over the deed is that the wiring in the house is pretty old and nonsensical. Sometimes, a light switch controls multiple lights: it might turn more than one light on at a time, and will also turn some lights off. Because the house is spooky, you need to figure out how to turn all of the lights on as quickly as possible.

The attorney recommends you try to make this into a game to help you practice and to distract you from the dark foreboding shadows that definitely are not hiding anything you need to worry about (but let’s turn the lights on just in case?).

Create a p5 program that will have at least 6 buttons - your light switches. Each light switch should control several other lights, and maybe also the light you clicked. Create a solvable puzzle game in which you need to find the right order to press the switches so all lights are turned on at once.


---

class: photoback
background-image: url('https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_2/2.3/image3.gif')

**Requirements**: Work with a partner or alone to complete the following:
  1. Create a game with at least six clickable buttons.
  1. Create a flowchart of your game so you can guarantee that there is a combination of switches that you can click to turn them all on, solving the puzzle.
  1. Create a p5 program where each switch turns a combination of lights on and/or off.
  1. Add any necessary design elements to make this game look appealing!

####Writing Prompt:

Describe your design process, including stepping through the code to explain exactly how to reach a solution and why your solution works.


####Extensions:

- Figure out how to draw a new background and “scene” if you win, so that the player knows they have completed the challenge.
- Figure out how to keep score, and make something happen if the user has clicked too many times without solving the puzzle.

##Using custom variables

```javascript

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 120);
}

function draw() {
  var x = 10; //set the initial size to 10

  rectMode(CENTER); //set the rectMode to center
  background(0);
  fill(255, 0, 0); //set the initial fill to red

  if (mouseX > 200) {
    x = 60;
  }
  //draw a rect at the center of the canvas
  rect(width / 2, height / 2, x, x);
}

```
.footer[2019.09.17]

--

####Try it: If the X position of the mouse passes the center of the canvas, the fill of the rectangle will turn blue.

---

##Try it:

Use the mouse position to change a variable and create an interactive sketch.

Requirements:

- Create more than two variations by writing a conditional statement using the x position and y position of your mouse.
- You can change the color, size or position of a shape. See this [example](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/HkHt9YKoM).
- You can adapt a previous sketch and add interactivity to it.

var radius1, radius2, theHue, sat;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
  colorMode(HSB);
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  theHue = map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, 360);
  sat = map(mouseY, 0, height, 0, 100);
  radius1 = map(mouseX, 0, width, 40, width/2);
  radius2 = map(mouseY, 0, height, 40, height/2);

  fill(theHue,sat,100);
  ellipse(width/2, height/2, radius1, radius2);

}

#What is p5.js?

- JavaScript Library for creating visual and interactive art (and more!)
- Works with *three* languages: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- This programming language will be used in this course to introduce basic programming concepts and apply them to create computational media by building expressive and interactive computer applications and media.

##Draw a robot...

Draw a robot using:

- Using only rectangles, circles, and ellipses
- Using at *least* 10 total shapes (can repeat the type of shape)

---

In p5 we use code to draw graphics on a canvas:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/visualoutcome.png" width = "700px"/>


---

The coordinate system is different...

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/coordinategrid.png" width = "700px"/>

---

Adjust your robot's coordinates:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/robot.png" width = "500px"/>



---

##Rectangles:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/heightwidthsquare.png" width = "400px"/>

##Ellipses:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/heightwidth.png" width = "400px"/>

---

#Write the info for your robot....

List the shapes and write down their information
