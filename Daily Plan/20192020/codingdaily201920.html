#2020.02.04 Coding

1. Status on Album Art - ?
2. Conditional Statements
3. Conditional Statement Assignment

---

##Conditionals - How can we get a program to take a different path?

###For example - can we change the color of a circle based on mouse location?

####We will look at:

- Conditional logical
- Boolean expressions - True or False

.footer[2020.02.04]

##What will this code do?

```javascript

function setup(){
    createCanvas(600, 120);
}

function draw() {

    background(225);

    if(mouseX > 300){
        background(0)
    }
}

```

.footer[2020.02.04]
---

##Using custom variables

```javascript

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 120);
}

function draw() {
  var x = 10; //set the initial size to 10

  rectMode(CENTER); //set the rectMode to center
  background(0);
  fill(255, 0, 0); //set the initial fill to red

  if (mouseX > 200) {
    x = 60;
  }
  //draw a rect at the center of the canvas
  rect(width / 2, height / 2, x, x);
}

```
.footer[2020.02.04]

--

####Try it: If the X position of the mouse passes the center of the canvas, the fill of the rectangle will turn blue.

---

##Try it:

Use the mouse position to change a variable and create an interactive sketch.

Requirements:

- Create more than two variations by writing a conditional statement using the x position and y position of your mouse.
- You can change the color, size or position of a shape. See this [example](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/HkHt9YKoM).
- You can adapt a previous sketch and add interactivity to it.

#2020.01.31 Coding


QotD:

1. `random()`
2. Abstract Album Art Project

---

class:photoback
background-image: url("https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/unit_1_finalproject_new.png")

#Abstract Album Art

In Fine Art, we often use abstraction to represent complex feelings, emotions, and moods by using shapes, strokes, and convey those feelings.

For some people with a condition called synesthesia, this is how they experience the world all the time. While scientists don't completely understand synesthesia, the rare phenomenon causes people to experience two senses at once. For example, when people hear music, they might also "see" colors. Or when they taste a flavor, they might also hear a certain tone.

In this project, we are going to imagine that we all have synesthesia. You will pick a song or album and create a dynamic (it changes!) album cover that represents the mood, emotions, and feelings present in the song/album. You should do your best to focus on representing these things with colors and shapes - for example, a dark, moody song might have a dark color palette. A song with a particular rhythm might have shapes in a pattern that mirror this beat.

While it's natural to want to utilize text or images, we are only going to use the tools we have learned so far in p5 for this project.

---

##Requirements:

1. Use shapes that we covered in this unit
1. Use built in variables that make your design dynamic (size or color changes with mouse position)
1. Create & use custom variables to control two or more elements of your design
1. Have your design change slightly each time it is run by using the random feature with some of your custom variables.(EX- have parts of your design move slightly each time the program is run, or shift slightly in color)

##Writing Prompt

Write a paragraph explaining your design decisions, including color choice and composition, and why it is representative of the album you chose.
---

##Extensions

**Level 1**:
- Students can complete and justify an album art cover.

**Level 2**:
  - Students leave thoughtful comments in their code that make it easier for an outsider to read.

**Level 3**:
  - Student code is free from superfluous lines (every line of code has a purpose) and is efficient.
  - Make a way to clear the canvas
  - Students can create an 'album launch' website to house their project. Research HTML and CSS on their own!

Copy code below, play with it, see what happens. We will discuss.


```javascript

var radius1, radius2, theHue, sat;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);

}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  theHue = map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, 360);
  sat = map(mouseY, 0, height, 0, 100);
  radius1 = map(mouseX, 0, width, 40, width/2);
  radius2 = map(mouseY, 0, height, 40, height/2);

  fill(theHue,sat,100);

##Draw a robot...

Draw a robot using:

- Using only rectangles, circles, and ellipses
- Using at *least* 10 total shapes (can repeat the type of shape)

---

In p5 we use code to draw graphics on a canvas:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/visualoutcome.png" width = "700px"/>


---

The coordinate system is different...

#Mini Project:

Using functions, create a character that responds to user clicks and key presses by changing its expression

- **Level 1**: Using functions, create a responsive character: when the user clicks, the character does something
- **Level 2**: Add a different response that happens when the user presses a key
- **Level 3**: Make a drawing stamp: when the user clicks, call your character-drawing function. Draw from two different types of character at random

#Flipbook

#p5 as a Flipbook

Because it repeats the draw loop we can use it like a flipbook, where it draws something over and over again, but we change its position

--

Lets draw an `ellipse()` on the left side of the screen and move it to the right side

--

1. assign `x` as a variable and give it the value of zero
--

2. Draw the `ellipse` at `x`
--

3. add 1 to the `x` or `x+=1`
--

---

#The Code...

```javascript

var x;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 120);
  x = 0; // Start at the left edge of the canvas
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  x = x + 1;  // Move slightly to the right

  ellipse(x, 60, 20, 20);
}

```

---

#How can we get the ellipse to come back?

--

#Conditionals!

--

```javascript

if(x > width){ // if the ball has passed the left edge of the canvas
   x = 0; //move the ball back to the right edge
  }

```


---

#Try it...

Make the following...

1. Something move right to left
2. Something falling
3. Something speeding up
4. Something slowing down
5. Something slowing down and then speeding up
6. Something moving diagonally
7. Something that bounces off the walls
8. Something that moves in `random()` directions
9. Control the speed with the arrow keys, or mouse clicks

#`colors` array

.center[
<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_3/2.1/table.png" width = "1000px"/>
]

[Example](https://editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/zPPyXXzoQ)

---

#Test it out

Make a building

Your building can look any way you want – as long as it has three or more floors,
all different colors. And how do we store these colors? In an array, of course!
You can make each floor an ellipse, a rectangle, even a triangle.
But when it comes to using `fill()` to color each floor, remember -- you should be
getting the color value from your array.

Extensions:

1. How could you maybe use another array to make your code even easier to understand and more simple?
2. What other values are you changing for each floor?
3. Could you change the text used for colors to RGB values instead?
4. Is there a way to do that using one array instead of three?

---

###What does this do?

```javascript
var colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'white'];
var color1, color2;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  color1 = colors[floor(random(0, colors.length))];
	color2 = colors[floor(random(0, colors.length))];
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  rectMode(CENTER);
  fill(color1);
  rect(100,100,100,100);
  fill(color2);
  ellipse(300,250,100);
}

```

---
##Exercise - Fortune Cookie

Pick 10 fortune cookie messages from this [list](https://quotes.yourdictionary.com/articles/funny-fortune-cookie-sayings.html), store them in an array, and whenever the user loads the sketch, a different text message will be displayed.

##Extensions

Use `random()` and multiple arrays to create one of the following:

- Group pairing program - Create a program that randomly pairs students in your class in a group project.
- Mad lib generator - Create a program that randomly inserts words in an existing sentence to make it funny, surreal, or just plain weird.
- Bonus: Make it interactive. Update or modify the parameter(s) whenever you press play, click, or press a key.

---

##Looping

```javascript
var colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  for(i = 0; i < colors.length; i++){
    // Fill with the right color
    fill(colors[i]);
    // draw a rectangle
    rect(i * 100, height / 2, 75, 75);
  }
}
```

---

#Exercise:

Scientists have recently discovered a big advance in snowman-building technology.
Gone are the days of cheery stovepipe hats and coal smiles. Gone are the days of carrot noses.
Modern snowmen, like modern buildings, are one thing, and one thing only: tall.

Scientists have developed a way of creating 7-snowball-high snowpeople that are
colored in every shade of the rainbow. Your mission, should you choose to accept it,
is to create a rainbow snowman using one, and only one, for loop to determine both
the position of each ellipse, the size of each ellipse, and the color of each ellipse.
Your snowman should come out looking something like this.

###Extension:

Upon clicking, randomize or reverse the order colors or the sizes!

#2019.10.18 Coding

QotD: If you go to any concert this weekend who would you see.

1. Wallpaper project mini project:
  - You recently have been hired by Microsoft’s design team to create 2 new wallpapers for their new line laptops. In order to boost sales and reach out to many different audiences, Microsoft would like these wallpapers to have some different color themes and use repetition. Be as creative and original as possible!

---

#Task

Create 2 variations of a desktop background using repeated elements. The design should be easily altered by changing the values in the for loop to create variations in the design.

---

#Requirements


1. Your canvas size should be (800 x 450)
1. The program should include at least one for loop.
1. The for loop(s) should be used to increment values such as width, height, or color.
1. Variations should result from changing different values in the loop. Tthe designs should not only vary in color. Play with size, number of repetitions etc.
1. Save three different variations of the same design.

---

##Task:

Draw five circles on a horizontal line, 100 pixels apart from each other.

---

###Now Draw them 50 pixels apart...

--

###Easy? Or tedious?

--

###There has to be a better way.

---

#Loops

##How we tell the computer to repeat itself, but change one aspect each time.

--

Look at your code for the 5 circles. What was similar and what was different about each line?

--

How could we simplify this code?

---

#Loops

1. Start at 100
--

2. If we haven't reached the edge of the screen
--

  - Draw ellipse
--

  - Move 100px to the right


---

#The Code

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#Three Steps For A While Loop

1. We declare and initialize a variable. Initializing a variable is setting the initial value for that variable, or where you want it to start. In this case, we would like to it begin at 100 pixels.
2. We check whether it meets a condition. The condition is inside the parentheses. We want to execute the code in the brackets on condition that x is still less than the width of the canvas.
3. We change the value of that variable in a way that will eventually make it meet the condition. In the code below, 100 is added to x inside the brackets. Every time the code is run x will increase by 100 until it's value is larger than the width of the canvas. Then the loop will be completed and the program will move on in the code.

---

#1. Initialize Variable

```javascript

*var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#2. Check Condition

```javascript

var x = 100;
*while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#Do the stuff

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
* ellipse(x,60,40,40);
  x = x + 100;
}

```

---

#3. Iterate Variable

```javascript

var x = 100;
while (x < width){
  ellipse(x,60,40,40);
* x = x + 100;
}

```

QotD: What weird quirks did you pick up from your parents?

1. Play each other's light switch challenge -- rotate around the room
2. Drawing with the mouse
3. Key Presses

---

**Prompt**

Remember the days of Microsoft Paint? When you could click a start bar, open a program that came preloaded on the computer, and just create? Those days were good. Those days were simple. Those days were internet free and possibly came with very little in the way of design sense.

We are better today; we have the tools needed to build our very own, p5 Microsoft Paint that looks better than ever before. And so that’s what we are going to do!

**Requirements**:

1. Create a program that allows you to draw with the mouse.
2. Create at least 4 buttons that will control different aspects of the program, such as color changes.
1. Create at least 4 key press reactions that will control different aspects of the program, such as brush type.
1. Make sure the user understands how to use your program!

**Writing Prompt**: Write a sales pitch for your program that includes instructions on how to use it and persuasive reasoning behind why you made your specific design choices.

---

**Extensions**

Level 1:
- Meets Requirements.

Level 2:
- At least 5 buttons.
- Create a drawing pen using the mouse ONLY when the mouse is being pressed
- Have one button be a random color

Level 3:
- Make an eraser
- Make a way to clear the canvas
- Make complex brush types, beyond just drawing with different shapes
- Create a website to house your creation

class: photoback
background-image: url('https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_2/2.3/image3.gif')

Congratulations! Your great aunt’s second cousin twice removed (on your mother’s side) has recently left you a spooky old house. This is great, because “free house”. As you can imagine, however, this does come with its fair share of problems, because spooky, and old.

The biggest problem your great aunt’s second cousin twice removed’s attorney warns you about when handing over the deed is that the wiring in the house is pretty old and nonsensical. Sometimes, a light switch controls multiple lights: it might turn more than one light on at a time, and will also turn some lights off. Because the house is spooky, you need to figure out how to turn all of the lights on as quickly as possible.

The attorney recommends you try to make this into a game to help you practice and to distract you from the dark foreboding shadows that definitely are not hiding anything you need to worry about (but let’s turn the lights on just in case?).

Create a p5 program that will have at least 6 buttons - your light switches. Each light switch should control several other lights, and maybe also the light you clicked. Create a solvable puzzle game in which you need to find the right order to press the switches so all lights are turned on at once.


---

class: photoback
background-image: url('https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_2/2.3/image3.gif')

**Requirements**: Work with a partner or alone to complete the following:
  1. Create a game with at least six clickable buttons.
  1. Create a flowchart of your game so you can guarantee that there is a combination of switches that you can click to turn them all on, solving the puzzle.
  1. Create a p5 program where each switch turns a combination of lights on and/or off.
  1. Add any necessary design elements to make this game look appealing!

####Writing Prompt:

Describe your design process, including stepping through the code to explain exactly how to reach a solution and why your solution works.


####Extensions:

- Figure out how to draw a new background and “scene” if you win, so that the player knows they have completed the challenge.
- Figure out how to keep score, and make something happen if the user has clicked too many times without solving the puzzle.

  rectMode(CENTER); //set the rectMode to center
  background(0);
  fill(255, 0, 0); //set the initial fill to red

  if (mouseX > 200) {
    x = 60;
  }
  //draw a rect at the center of the canvas
  rect(width / 2, height / 2, x, x);
}

```
.footer[2019.09.17]

--

####Try it: If the X position of the mouse passes the center of the canvas, the fill of the rectangle will turn blue.

---

##Try it:

Use the mouse position to change a variable and create an interactive sketch.

Requirements:

- Create more than two variations by writing a conditional statement using the x position and y position of your mouse.
- You can change the color, size or position of a shape. See this [example](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/HkHt9YKoM).
- You can adapt a previous sketch and add interactivity to it.

#What is p5.js?

- JavaScript Library for creating visual and interactive art (and more!)
- Works with *three* languages: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- This programming language will be used in this course to introduce basic programming concepts and apply them to create computational media by building expressive and interactive computer applications and media.

##Draw a robot...

Draw a robot using:

- Using only rectangles, circles, and ellipses
- Using at *least* 10 total shapes (can repeat the type of shape)

---

In p5 we use code to draw graphics on a canvas:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/visualoutcome.png" width = "700px"/>


---

The coordinate system is different...

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/coordinategrid.png" width = "700px"/>

---

Adjust your robot's coordinates:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/robot.png" width = "500px"/>



---

##Rectangles:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/heightwidthsquare.png" width = "400px"/>

##Ellipses:

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/heightwidth.png" width = "400px"/>

---

#Write the info for your robot....

List the shapes and write down their information

<img src="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/images/lessons/unit_1/1.1/shapeinstructions.png" width = "700px"/>
