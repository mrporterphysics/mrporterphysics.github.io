- Get into a group of 3 and compare your examples.

--
- Write down a list of your group's best examples of **models** on a whiteboard

--
- Consider how you are defining the word *model* as you make your list

---

# 2018.09.24 Regents Physics

1. Buggy Lab
2. Buggy Lab Analysis
3. Buggy Lab Board Meeting

**Note: Answers to proportional reasoning will be posted on classroom -- check them and come back with any questions you may have.

---

##The Buggy Lab

--

###Step 1: Observations

--

###Step 2: What observations can we measure?

--

###Step 3: Can we predict the motion of the buggy? (control variables)

--

###Step 4: What questions can we ask and answer through experiment?

--

### Step 5: Anything else?

---

##The Buggy Lab

###Goal:
Create a descriptive model for motion using your toy buggy.

###Essential Questions:
1. Does your buggy move in a consistent manner?
  - How does the _position_ of your buggy relate to the _clock reading_
2. Does your starting position matter?
3. How does your buggy differ (in terms of motion) from the other groups buggies?

# 2018.09.20 Regents Physics

2. Proportional Reasoning Questions in pairs
3. Buggy lab

##2018.09.18 Regents Physics - Do Now

I. In the equation `\(y=\frac{ab^2}{c}\)` what happens to `\(y\)` if `\(a\)` is doubled?


II. In the equation `\(y=\frac{ab^2}{c}\)` what happens to `\(y\)` if `\(c\)` is tripled?


III. In the equation `\(y=\frac{ab^2}{c}\)` what happens to `\(y\)` if `\(c\)` is quadrupled?

---

##2018.09.18 Regents Physics

1. Linearization practice - work in pairs, spread out and we will return to review our answers.
2. Proportional, Direct, Indirect, and Inverse Relationships.
3. Time Dependent: Intro to the Buggy Lab

---

**Direct Relationship**: Increasing one variable will increase the other.

**Indirect Relationship**: Increasing one variable will decrease the other.

**Proportional Relationship**: Doubling one variable will double the other. (No intecepts!)
