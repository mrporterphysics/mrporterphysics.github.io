  + Can you get the same range with two angles?
3. How to: Projectiles at an Angle:
  - Find intial velocity components
  - Time still links horizontal and vertical motion
  - Use Equations:

Question: Herman the human cannonball is launched from level ground at an angle of 30° above the horizontal with an initial velocity of 26 m/s. How far does Herman travel horizontally before reuniting with the ground?

2. Board Meeting Results:
  - What patterns do you notice?
  - How do the mallet taps affect the motion of the bowling ball?
  - How do the interactions between the bowling ball and the mallet result in constant velocity or constant acceleration models for the bowling ball's motion?

We will finish the rolling ball problem next class.
