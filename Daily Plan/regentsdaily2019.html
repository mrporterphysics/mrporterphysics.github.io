##On your own:

- Now that you have seen my examples of **Models** write down a few more of your own on your sheet of paper.

--
- Get into a group of 3 and compare your examples.

--
- Write down a list of your group's best examples of **models** on a whiteboard

--
- Consider how you are defining the word *model* as you make your list

---

class:center, middle

##Share model examples, compare and contrast differences. Make a list as a class of models.

---

##Write down a definition of model with your group on your whiteboard.

---

#Are these examples of models based on your definition?

- a paper airplane
- observing a bird at a bird feeder
- making an analogy ("the heart is like a pump")
- forming a mental image of molecules in a liquid state
- going on a field trip to the Grand Canyon

# 2018.09.24 Regents Physics

1. Buggy Lab
2. Buggy Lab Analysis
3. Buggy Lab Board Meeting

**Note: Answers to proportional reasoning will be posted on classroom -- check them and come back with any questions you may have.

---

##The Buggy Lab

--

###Step 1: Observations

--

###Step 2: What observations can we measure?

--

###Step 3: Can we predict the motion of the buggy? (control variables)

--

###Step 4: What questions can we ask and answer through experiment?

--

### Step 5: Anything else?

---

##The Buggy Lab

###Goal:
Create a descriptive model for motion using your toy buggy.

###Essential Questions:
1. Does your buggy move in a consistent manner?
  - How does the _position_ of your buggy relate to the _clock reading_
2. Does your starting position matter?
3. How does your buggy differ (in terms of motion) from the other groups buggies?


---


# 2018.09.20 Regents Physics

1. Review Linearization Practice - compare answers between each other
2. Proportional Reasoning Questions in pairs
3. Buggy lab

##2018.09.18 Regents Physics - Do Now

I. In the equation `\(y=\frac{ab^2}{c}\)` what happens to `\(y\)` if `\(a\)` is doubled?


II. In the equation `\(y=\frac{ab^2}{c}\)` what happens to `\(y\)` if `\(c\)` is tripled?


III. In the equation `\(y=\frac{ab^2}{c}\)` what happens to `\(y\)` if `\(c\)` is quadrupled?

---

##2018.09.18 Regents Physics

1. Linearization practice - work in pairs, spread out and we will return to review our answers.
2. Proportional, Direct, Indirect, and Inverse Relationships.
3. Time Dependent: Intro to the Buggy Lab

---

**Direct Relationship**: Increasing one variable will increase the other.

**Indirect Relationship**: Increasing one variable will decrease the other.

**Proportional Relationship**: Doubling one variable will double the other. (No intecepts!)

####Learning Goals:
- *I can design an experiment to investigate new phenomena, test hypotheses and solve experimental problems*
- *I can collect and analyze experimental data*
  - *I can linearize experimental data*
- *I can communicate with my peers about science*


2. Why do we not want to "play find the right curve"?
3. How to linearize to find the relationship
4. 6 (main) types of mathematical relationships in physics
5. Linearize your data from stations labs in Pivot.
  - Add new columns, use the calculate functions
  - Write a second results statement for each lab (the slope of this assignment will be 2 results statements **for each** one additional lab...haha funny Porter 🤣)
6. Whiteboard lab results - one group per lab
6. Proportional Reasoning

7. Exit Ticket: In your own words, describe why we linearize data for analysis instead of using curve fitting.


---

##2018.09.12 Do Now

On a scrap piece of paper, write the equation for this experiment, and determine the physical meaning of the slope and intercept.

###End of Class To Do:

- Save Pivot
-  Clean up area, mark the cup you are using (so you use the same cup next time)
  - is there anything else you need to measure to start taking data again tomorrow? (i.e. chair distance, chair orientation, etc)
- Erase whiteboard and return whiteboard markers
- Answer question on Google Classroom
