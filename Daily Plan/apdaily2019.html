# AP Physics Daily Plans 2018-2019

### *"Learning happens when you think hard"*

### *Make that Myelin*

### **Mastery Mindset**

### **\#ImpactLearning**

---

##2018.09.17 AP Physics

1. Do Now:
  - Take out homework (or flip to the page)
  - Answer questions on half sheet of paper (by the door). Try to do this on your own.
2. Homework policies
3. Our First Paradigm Lab: The _The Buggy Lab_
4. Goal: finish data collection and preboard lab questions before the end of class.
5. Exit Ticket

---

##The Buggy Lab

--

###Step 1: Observations

--

###Step 2: What observations can we measure?

--

###Step 3: Can we predict the motion of the buggy? (control variables)

--

###Step 4: What questions can we ask and answer through experiment?

--

### Step 5: Anything else?

---

##The Buggy Lab

###Goal:
Create a descriptive model for motion using your toy buggy.

###Essential Questions:
1. Does your buggy move in a consistent manner?
  - How does the _position_ of your buggy relate to the _clock reading_
2. Does your starting position matter?
3. How does your buggy differ (in terms of motion) from the other groups buggies?


---

##The Buggy Lab

###On your whiteboard:

- What buggy you had
- _Short_ summary of your procedure
- Your results
- Do your results answer the experimental questions? If so how? (Bullet points, not long paragraphs)


---


##2018.09.14 AP Phyiscs - Do Now:

(1) Pick up packet by door. (2) On a scrap piece of paper, write the equation for this experiment, and determine the physical meaning of the slope and intercept.

##2018.09.14 AP Physics

####Learning Goals:
- *I can design an experiment to investigate new phenomena, test hypotheses and solve experimental problems*
- *I can collect and analyze experimental data*
  - *I can linearize experimental data*
- *I can communicate with my peers about science*

1. Pick up packet if you have not yet.
2. Download graphical analysis (link on classroom)
2. Why are do we not want to "play find the right curve"?
3. How to linearize to find the relationship
4. 6 (main) types of mathematical relationships in physics
5. Linearize your data from stations labs in Pivot.
  - Add new columns, use the calculate functions
  - Write a second results statement for each lab (the slope of this assignment will be 2 results statements **for each** one additional lab...haha funny Porter ü§£)
6. Proportional Reasoning

**HW**: Get contracts signed, linearization practice, finish proportional reasoning in packet

##2018.09.13 AP Physics

####Learning Goals:
- *I can design an experiment to investigate new phenomena, test hypotheses and solve experimental problems*
- *I can collect and analyze experimental data*
- *I can communicate with my peers about science*

1. Finish collecting lab data
2. Write a general description of the results for each experiment.
3. Introduction to Linearization
4. Linearize data from experiment
5. Whiteboard **one** of the labs (assigned by Mr. Porter)
6. Present results of your lab to the class
7. Exit Ticket: In your own words, describe why we linearize data for analysis instead of using curve fitting.

**Homework:** Get saftey contract signed

##2018.09.11 AP Physics

####Learning Goals:
- *I can design an experiment to investigate new phenomena, test hypotheses and solve experimental problems*
- *I can collect and analyze experimental data*
- *I can communicate with my peers about science*

1. **Do Now**: Write down two things that are important to designed a "good" experiment and why they are important to a good experiment. (You can use a scrap piece of paper. There are half sheets by the door.)
2. Experimental Design and Linear Modeling.
3. Stations Lab (focus on designing your experiment and collecting data today):
  - Station 1: Pendulum
  - Station 2: Photogates and Ramp
  - Station 3: Cart Launcher
  - Station 4: Golf Ball
  - Station 5: Ball and Ramp
  - Station 6: Video Analysis

##2018.09.10 AP Physics

####Learning Goals:
- *I can design an experiment to investigate new phenomena, test hypotheses and solve experimental problems*
- *I can collect and analyze experimental data*
- *I can communicate with my peers about science*

1. Pasta Bridge Lab - Start right away, don't wait for any instruction, gather your materials with your group and go
2. Lab Board Meeting:
  - On your whiteboard:
    - How you did your lab (summary)
    - What you found (results)
    - Present then information in the way you believe is best
3. Experimental Design and Linear Modeling
4. Exit Ticket: two things you learned today (on classroom)

---

##2018.09.07 AP Physics

1. Grab a handout, find a sit at the big table, and answer the 3 questions on the handout.
2. Fill out the back of your index card with:
  - Your name
  - a phone number or numbers where you can be reached if you happen to over sleep for the midterm or final.
  - in your opinion the best candy ever
3. Lab Grouping activity
4. Survival Plans üèùÔ∏è
5. Technology Administrata:
  - Sign up for Google Classroom
  - Sign up for Pivot Interactives (online lab notebook)
6. Pasta Bridge Lab üçù
7. Exit ticket üéüÔ∏è: Class reflection on classroom

#2018.09.07 AP Physics

###End of Class To Do:

- Save Pivot
-  Clean up area, mark the cup you are using (so you use the same cup next time)
  - is there anything else you need to measure to start taking data again tomorrow? (i.e. chair distance, chair orientation, etc)
- Erase whiteboard and return whiteboard markers
- Answer question on Google Classroom
