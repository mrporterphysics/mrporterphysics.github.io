---

##The Buggy Lab

--

###Step 1: Observations

--

###Step 2: What observations can we measure?

--

###Step 3: Can we predict the motion of the buggy? (control variables)

--

###Step 4: What questions can we ask and answer through experiment?

--

### Step 5: Anything else?

---

##The Buggy Lab

###Goal:
Create a descriptive model for motion using your toy buggy.

###Essential Questions:
1. Does your buggy move in a consistent manner?
  - How does the _position_ of your buggy relate to the _clock reading_
2. Does your starting position matter?
3. How does your buggy differ (in terms of motion) from the other groups buggies?


---

##The Buggy Lab

###On your whiteboard:

- What buggy you had
- _Short_ summary of your procedure
- Your results
- Do your results answer the experimental questions? If so how? (Bullet points, not long paragraphs)


---


##2018.09.14 AP Phyiscs - Do Now:

(1) Pick up packet by door. (2) On a scrap piece of paper, write the equation for this experiment, and determine the physical meaning of the slope and intercept.

  - is there anything else you need to measure to start taking data again tomorrow? (i.e. chair distance, chair orientation, etc)
- Erase whiteboard and return whiteboard markers
- Answer question on Google Classroom
