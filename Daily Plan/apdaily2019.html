Miss Halaquist Question of the day:

What is your silliest fear?

1. Test Thursday
  - Solutions for MC on practice are posted, free-response will be posted tonight
  - Solutions to packet questions are also posted on classroom
2. Ballistics Lab:
  - Goal: Determine the Muzzle Velocity of your dart.
  - This lab will review a lot of the physics you should know to date!
  - ***<u>Note</u>: If you shoot the nerf gun in a "non-physics manner" (open to determination by me and me only) you will be removed from the lab and will have to complete a separate assignment.***

#Cart Launch - What graph attributes have we tried?

<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/anyry0pwr7?embed" width="1000px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
---

#Cart Launch - Force vs. Displacement Graph

--

- What is the equation for area (for this specific force vs. displacement graph)?

--
  + `\(Area = \frac{1}{2}k\Delta x^2\)`

--
- What are the units for area:

--
  + N`\(\cdot\)`m

--
- What does this area describe? What did it allow us to determine?

--
- Would we have gotten the same velocity if we used different masses? Why or why not? Test it.


---

#Cart Launch - Force vs. Displacement Graph

- *Area* of the Force vs. Displacement graph is the energy that the spring "gives" to the cart system. We call this the ***Work*** that the spring does on the cart system.

--
- For *hookean springs* the equation for this work is:  `\(W = \frac{1}{2}k\Delta x^2\)`

--
- We cannot use forces to predict the final velocity of the cart because of the non-uniform acceleration

--
- The energy that the cart has is its ***Kinetic Energy*** or energy in motion

---

#Lab - Work and speed

###Develop and carry out an experiment that will determine the relationship between the **Work** that the spring does on the cart system and the resulting velocity that the cart gains.


---

***2019.02.06 AP Physics - Do Now:***

11 identical springs are stretched with a mass different distances and held in place with a string. The string is cut and the springs oscillate (move up and down repeatedly).

.center[<img src="G:\My Drive\GitHub\mrporterphysics.github.io\Daily Plan\springs_ranking.png" width = "700px"/>]

Rank from greatest to least: (1) The spring force on each mass at rest, (2) the speed through the equilibrium point (dotted line) and (3) the period of oscillation (time for one up and down).

#Paragraph Length Response:

In trial 2 the heavier ball will land a distance less than `\(d\)` from the table.
Increasing the mass of the ball will decrease the acceleration of the system despite having the same net force as trial 1.
Increasing mass with the same net force decreases acceleration because of the inverse mass-acceleration relationship in Newton's Second Law
(`\(a = \frac{\Sigma F}{m}\)`). With a smaller acceleration the ball will accelerate to a lesser velocity after traveling a distance
`\(\Delta x\)`. This lesser velocity gives a smaller launch velocity when the cart hits the bumper.
The range is determined with `\(x = vt\)` so decreasing the velocity will decrease the range because the ball is in the air the same amount of time for both trial 1 and 2.

5. Linearize your data from stations labs in Pivot.
  - Add new columns, use the calculate functions
  - Write a second results statement for each lab (the slope of this assignment will be 2 results statements **for each** one additional lab...haha funny Porter 🤣)
6. Proportional Reasoning

**HW**: Get contracts signed, linearization practice, finish proportional reasoning in packet

####Learning Goals:
- *I can design an experiment to investigate new phenomena, test hypotheses and solve experimental problems*
- *I can collect and analyze experimental data*
- *I can communicate with my peers about science*

1. Finish collecting lab data
2. Write a general description of the results for each experiment.
3. Introduction to Linearization
4. Linearize data from experiment
5. Whiteboard **one** of the labs (assigned by Mr. Porter)
6. Present results of your lab to the class
7. Exit Ticket: In your own words, describe why we linearize data for analysis instead of using curve fitting.

**Homework:** Get saftey contract signed

####Learning Goals:
- *I can design an experiment to investigate new phenomena, test hypotheses and solve experimental problems*
- *I can collect and analyze experimental data*
- *I can communicate with my peers about science*

1. **Do Now**: Write down two things that are important to designed a "good" experiment and why they are important to a good experiment. (You can use a scrap piece of paper. There are half sheets by the door.)
2. Experimental Design and Linear Modeling.
3. Stations Lab (focus on designing your experiment and collecting data today):
  - Station 1: Pendulum
  - Station 2: Photogates and Ramp
  - Station 3: Cart Launcher
  - Station 4: Golf Ball
  - Station 5: Ball and Ramp
  - Station 6: Video Analysis

- *I can communicate with my peers about science*

1. Pasta Bridge Lab - Start right away, don't wait for any instruction, gather your materials with your group and go
2. Lab Board Meeting:
  - On your whiteboard:
    - How you did your lab (summary)
    - What you found (results)
    - Present then information in the way you believe is best
3. Experimental Design and Linear Modeling
4. Exit Ticket: two things you learned today (on classroom)

2. Fill out the back of your index card with:
  - Your name
  - a phone number or numbers where you can be reached if you happen to over sleep for the midterm or final.
  - in your opinion the best candy ever
3. Lab Grouping activity
4. Survival Plans 🏝️
5. Technology Administrata:
  - Sign up for Google Classroom

###End of Class To Do:

- Save Pivot
-  Clean up area, mark the cup you are using (so you use the same cup next time)
  - is there anything else you need to measure to start taking data again tomorrow? (i.e. chair distance, chair orientation, etc)
- Erase whiteboard and return whiteboard markers
- Answer question on Google Classroom
