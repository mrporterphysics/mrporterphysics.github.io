- What is the **slope**? 
  - _For every_ statement ("_The **y quantity** changes **the slope number** <y units> for every 1 **x quantity** <x units>_")
- What is the **intercept**?
- What do they represent?

# Data Collection 📊

1. Go to [Data Collection Best Practices Interactive](https://www.mrporterphysics.com/AP%20Resource%20Pages/datacollection.html)
2. Read and click through the examples
3. Reflect on your _Coefficient of Restitution_ lab, did you follow these practices? How can you improve upon your design?

# Dune Buggy Challenge 🚗

### Question:

How much time does it take a Dune Buggy car to travel a specified distance?

### Purpose:

To collect distance-time data for a Dune Buggy Car in order to predict the time it takes a Dune Buggy to travel a specified distance

### Data & Prediction

- when graphing put time on the **horizontal** axis

---

#### Claim:

I predicted that it would take my Dune Buggy car _______________ to travel the specified distance of ______________ cm.

### Evidence:

(Discuss values from your Data section...identifying the data that you used to determine the prediction. Use specifics in your discussion.)

### Reasoning:

(Explain in a few sentences why this evidence provides logical support for believing that your claim is true. And while you’re at it, you ought to mention how well...or not well...that you did.)

# 📓 Lab Notebooks 📓 <!--fit--->

---

# What is a Lab Notebook?

* A detailed, chronological record of a scientist's research activities, experiments, and observations. 
* Documentation of the scientific process from intial ideas to final results and conclusions. 

---

# Why keep lab notebooks?

* Document Research
* Develop Ideas
* Organize Data 
* Collaboration Tool
* Publication Support
* Troubleshooting 
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Historical Record

---

# Lab Notebooks can be Legal Documents 

* Proof of invention in Patent Cases
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Admissibility in court - must be properly maintained
* Note: Often property of the instituation where the research was conducted (i.e. Property of Regeneron, or Property of Cornell University)

---

# Remember

* Lab notebooks are most importantly scientific documentation
* They represent the scientific process and are record of your **thinking**
    * This means your ideas and conclusions and hypotheses can **change** based on **new data**

---

# Lab Notebook

* Write in **pen**
* All mistakes get a ~~single cross through~~
* Full Date (YYYY/MM/DD) at the beginning of each entry (for multiday labs date start of each day)
* Enter Lab Pages into table of contents 

---

# Lab Notebook - Pre Lab

* **Title and objective of the experiment**: 
  - Write a clear, concise title for each experiment.
  - State the main objective or purpose of the experiment in 1-2 sentences.
* ***Theoretical background**: 
  - Briefly explain the relevant scientific principles.
  - Include key equations or concepts that will be tested or applied.
* **Hypotheses**: 

  - State your predictions about the experiment's outcome.
  - Base these on your understanding of the theory.

---

# Lab Notebook - Pre Lab

* **Materials and equipment list**: 
  - Provide a detailed list of all materials and equipment used.
  - Include model numbers and specifications where relevant.
* **Experimental procedure outline**: 
  - Write a step-by-step outline of the planned procedure.
  - Be specific enough that someone could replicate your experiment.

---

# During the Experiment

* **Raw data in tables with units**: 
  - Create neat, organized tables for all numerical data.
  - Always include units and uncertainty estimates.
  - Label columns clearly and use consistent significant figures.
* **Observations and qualitative notes**: 
  - Record all relevant observations, even if they seem unimportant.
  - Note any unexpected occurrences or anomalies.

---

# During the Experiment 

* **Any changes to the planned procedure**: 
  - Document any deviations from the original procedure.
  - Explain why changes were made and how they might affect results.
* **Sketches or diagrams of experimental setup**: 
  - Include clear, labeled diagrams of your experimental setup.
  - Add dimensions and important details to aid in replication.

---

# Post Lab

* **Data analysis and calculations**: 
  - Show all steps in your calculations, including formulas used.
  - Explain your reasoning for each step of the analysis.
* **Graphs and charts**: 
  - Create neat, properly labeled graphs and charts.
  - Include titles, axis labels with units, and legends where appropriate.

---

# Post Lab

* **Discussion of results**: 
  - Interpret your results in the context of the experiment's objectives.
  - Explain any patterns or trends observed in the data
* **Comparison with hypotheses**: 
  - Explicitly state whether your results support or refute your hypotheses.
  - Discuss possible reasons for any discrepancies.
* **Sources of error and uncertainty**: 
  - Identify potential sources of experimental error.
  - Discuss how these might have affected your results.
  - Quantify uncertainties where possible.

---

# Post Lab

- **Conclusions**: 
  - Summarize the main findings of the experiment.
  - Relate these back to the original objectives and broader scientific principles.
  - Suggest improvements or future directions for the experiment.
