# Team Solving

### Solve with your lab group on a whiteboard

A red car (on left) and a green car (on right) are spaced **$1200\text{ m}$** apart (distance a). They start at the same time and head towards each other. The red car averages a speed of **$13.2\text{ m/s}$**. The green car averages a speed of **$16.8\text{ m/s}$**. What distance will the red car have traveled (distance b) when it is at the same position as the green car?

# Dueling Buggies Lab

## Lab Question

How can we use measurements and models to predict the meeting point of two battery-powered buggies, one fast and one slow, when they move toward each other from known starting positions?

## Lab Purpose

To determine and test the predicted meeting point of two buggies moving at constant, but different, speeds toward each other, using measurements, motion maps, graphs, and algebraic models.

---

## Procedure Overview

1) In teams, measure all properties you think are necessary to predict how the fast and slow buggies will move (speed, direction, etc.).
2) Record your measurements and describe your methods.
3) After measurements, your buggies will be collected. The teacher will mark two starting lines: one for the fast buggy and one for the slow buggy.
4) Using your data, determine and clearly mark on the floor where you predict the two buggies will meet if started at the same time.

---

# Procedure Overview

5) Use at least two different approaches (motion maps, position-time graphs, algebraic equations, etc.) to support your prediction.
6) Once you have made your prediction, test it by running the buggies from the assigned start lines.
7) Record and analyze the outcome.

---

## Data Section

- Table of measurements for each buggy (speed, direction, other relevant properties)
- Sample calculations for determining speed
- Sample calculations for determining speed
- Diagrams, graphs, or descriptions of any modeling tools used
- Sketches or descriptions of motion maps and position-time graphs
- Written description of your prediction process

**Question:**  How can different types of walking motion be represented and interpreted using position-time and velocity-time graphs?

**Purpose:**  To investigate how various walking motions (such as walking away from or toward the sensor, walking at different speeds, or stopping and starting) are represented on position-time and velocity-time graphs, and to develop an understanding of the relationship between motion and its graphical representation.


**Instructions for Lab Notebook Reflection:**
