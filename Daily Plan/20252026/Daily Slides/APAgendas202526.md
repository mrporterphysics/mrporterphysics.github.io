#  Photogate Timing Lab
Target: time between photogates = **0.12 s**

![center w:700](image-14.png)

The figure above shows a cart on an inclined ramp. The cart is released from rest a distance $\Delta x_1 = 20\text{ cm}$ from photogate 1. You are tasked to determine the distance from photogate 1, $\Delta x_2$, to put a second photogate, so that the time it takes for the cart to travel between the two gates is $\Delta t = 0.12\text{ s}$.

---

## Question
How far from photogate 1 should photogate 2 be placed to get **0.12 s** between gates?

---

## Purpose
Use the constant-acceleration particle model to:
- Measure ramp acceleration from rest.
- Predict photogate spacing **Δx2** for the target interval.

---

## Materials
Cart, inclined ramp, 2 photogates + timer, meterstick, tape, angle finder (optional), data table.

---

## Procedure (Measure a)
1. Mark release point **Δx1 = 20 cm** above gate 1; start cart from rest.
2. Place gates; record gate times or interval over known spacing.
3. Repeat 5 trials; keep setup identical.

---

## Determine Acceleration


## Predict Spacing
- Derive **Δx2(Δx1, a, Δt)** from CAPM equations.
- Compute **Δx2** for **Δt = 0.12 s**.

---

## Test & Validate
- Place gate 2 at predicted **Δx2**.
- Run 3 trials; compare to 0.12 s.
- Compute percent error.

---

## Representations

- v–t with slope **a**.
- x–t showing curvature.
- Equations + sample calc with units.

---

## Reflection
- Does data support constant **a**?
- How does steeper ramp (larger **a**) affect **Δx2** for same **Δt**?
- Evaluate the peer claim about moving gate 1 closer.

---

## Notebook Checklist


✅ Titles
✅ Procedures and data
✅ labeled tables/graphs
✅ units
✅ best-fit lines
✅ clear conclusion & reflection questions

# Ticker Tape Best Practices

- how to set up the spark timer to collect good data:
  - length of tape = length of run, make sure tape is shorter than track so it is pulled all of the way through
  - label tape after collecting data
    - trial #, where zero is
  - need to pull tape through timer **BEFORE** taping to cart
- **Note** You do not need to record _every_ ticker mark...but be sure to follow the 8x10 rule. More data is better here if you have it!

# What is a Lab Notebook?

* A detailed, chronological record of a scientist's research activities, experiments, and observations. 
* Documentation of the scientific process from intial ideas to final results and conclusions. 

---

# Why keep lab notebooks?

* Document Research
* Develop Ideas
* Organize Data 
* Collaboration Tool
* Publication Support
* Troubleshooting 
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Historical Record

---

# Lab Notebooks can be Legal Documents 

* Proof of invention in Patent Cases
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Admissibility in court - must be properly maintained
* Note: Often property of the instituation where the research was conducted (i.e. Property of Regeneron, or Property of Cornell University)

---

# Remember

* Lab notebooks are most importantly scientific documentation
* They represent the scientific process and are record of your **thinking**
    * This means your ideas and conclusions and hypotheses can **change** based on **new data**

---

# Lab Notebook

* Write in **pen**
* All mistakes get a ~~single cross through~~
* Full Date (YYYY/MM/DD) at the beginning of each entry (for multiday labs date start of each day)
* Enter Lab Pages into table of contents

# Ball Bounce Lab

#### Question:

Is the coefficient of restitution constant for your ball? Do this by comparing drop height to bounce height for your assigned ball.


#### Background: 

The coefficient of restitution (symbol: $e$) is a dimensionless quantity that describes how much energy is conserved in a collision, specifically how well an object bounces back after impact. It is used to characterize the elasticity of collisions between two bodies.
