**A motor swings a ball on a string in a vertical circle such that the tension in the string is constant throughout the ball's motion. Which of the following  correctly indicates at which point the ball has the greatest speed and provides a valid justification?**

A. At the topmost point, because the tension force and gravitational force are both directed toward the center of the ball's motion.
B. At the topmost point, because the net force on the ball is zero.
C. At the bottommost point, because the tension offsets the gravitational force.
D. At the bottommost point, because the net force on the ball is a maximum.

- <mark>**Force of Gravity**</mark> - an attractive force between **any** two objects with mass
- <mark>**Weight**</mark> - $\vec{F}_g$ between celestial object and object of interest 
  - (i.e. your weight is the $\vec{F}_g$ between Earth and you)
- <mark>**Mass**</mark> - How much matter an object contains, a measurement of how much "stuff" an object is made of

---

# Question
How does weight (gravitational force) depend on mass and the local gravitational field?

---

# Purpose
- Measure F and m for several objects
- Build a model from data (F vs. m)
- Interpret slope (if linear)

---

# Spring Force Lab

### Purpose:

Determine the relationship between the stretch displacement of your spring and the force that is used to stretch the spring. 

### Materials
- two springs (to compare results)
- assorted masses (your known forces)
- ruler/meterstick

Water skiers are pulled at a _constant speed_ by a towrope attached to a speedboat. Because the weight of the skiers and the type of skis they are using varies, they experience different resistive forces from the water. Values for this resistive force (RF) and for the speed of the skiers are given.

Sharon Steady and Al Wayskachon won South’s recent egg toss contest held during Homecoming week. In their winning toss, Sharon gave the egg an underhand toss, releasing it with a velocity of 7.5 m/s at an angle of 30° to the horizontal. To the pleasure of the crowd, Al caught the egg at the same height as the toss without even a fracture to its shell.

1. Calculate the time for the egg to reach the midpoint of the trajectory.
2. Calculate the total time the egg is in the air.
3. Calculate the horizontal distance which the egg traveled.
4. Calculate the height of the egg (relative to the release point) when it was at the peak of its trajectory.

# Test Corrections

---

## Why do corrections?
- Learn from errors, not just the grade
- Make thinking visible (CER + diagrams)
- Target misconceptions and fix them
- Build metacognitive habits to perform better next time


---

## Corrections Process

We will use the same steps for every correction:
1) **Decode the Problem**
    1. Translate
    2. Big Physics Ideas
    3. Givens & Unknowns (units; axes/signs)
    4. Sketch
    5. Simplify & Diagram
2) **Do the Physics**
    1. Represent Mathematically (Solve Algebraically)
    2. Solve & Evaluate
3) **Explain & Learn**: CER + 4 C’s + Preventive Cue

---

## Where & When
- Complete within ~1 week of test return
- In school only (class, study hall, breakout space)
- Start from scratch (no copying prior answers)

---

## Points-back policy (curve)
- Awarded for high-quality corrections
- Curve: $\sqrt{\frac{(\text{points earned} + \text{1/2 points back})}{\text{total points}}}$
- Quality = correct solution + diagram + CER + error type + reflection

---

## Example - Together

### Q10 - Boat across a river


---

## Quality Checklist
- Correct solution from scratch
- Named physics principle/fact
- Accurate, labeled diagram
- Clear CER
- Error type + preventive cue
- Unit/sign/limiting-case checks

---

## Final Reflection (Exam Wrapper)
- Patterns across missed items
- Strategy changes for next exam
- Practice targets and timeline
- Meet with Mr. Porter before submitting

#  Photogate Timing Lab
Target: time between photogates = **0.12 s**

![center w:700](image-14.png)

The figure above shows a cart on an inclined ramp. The cart is released from rest a distance $\Delta x_1 = 20\text{ cm}$ from photogate 1. You are tasked to determine the distance from photogate 1, $\Delta x_2$, to put a second photogate, so that the time it takes for the cart to travel between the two gates is $\Delta t = 0.12\text{ s}$.

---

## Question
How far from photogate 1 should photogate 2 be placed to get **0.12 s** between gates?

---

## Purpose
Use the constant-acceleration particle model to:
- Measure ramp acceleration from rest.
- Predict photogate spacing **Δx2** for the target interval.

---

## Materials
Cart, inclined ramp, 2 photogates + timer, meterstick, tape, angle finder (optional), data table.

---

## Procedure (Measure a)
1. Mark release point **Δx1 = 20 cm** above gate 1; start cart from rest.
2. Place gates; record gate times or interval over known spacing.
3. Repeat 5 trials; keep setup identical.

---

## Determine Acceleration


## Predict Spacing
- Derive **Δx2(Δx1, a, Δt)** from CAPM equations.
- Compute **Δx2** for **Δt = 0.12 s**.

---

## Test & Validate
- Place gate 2 at predicted **Δx2**.
- Run 3 trials; compare to 0.12 s.
- Compute percent error.

---

## Representations

- v–t with slope **a**.
- x–t showing curvature.
- Equations + sample calc with units.

---

## Reflection
- Does data support constant **a**?
- How does steeper ramp (larger **a**) affect **Δx2** for same **Δt**?
- Evaluate the peer claim about moving gate 1 closer.

---

## Notebook Checklist


✅ Titles
✅ Procedures and data
✅ labeled tables/graphs
✅ units
✅ best-fit lines
✅ clear conclusion & reflection questions

# Ticker Tape Best Practices

- how to set up the spark timer to collect good data:
  - length of tape = length of run, make sure tape is shorter than track so it is pulled all of the way through
  - label tape after collecting data
    - trial #, where zero is
  - need to pull tape through timer **BEFORE** taping to cart
- **Note** You do not need to record _every_ ticker mark...but be sure to follow the 8x10 rule. More data is better here if you have it!

# What is a Lab Notebook?

* A detailed, chronological record of a scientist's research activities, experiments, and observations. 
* Documentation of the scientific process from intial ideas to final results and conclusions. 

---

# Why keep lab notebooks?

* Document Research
* Develop Ideas
* Organize Data 
* Collaboration Tool
* Publication Support
* Troubleshooting 
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Historical Record

---

# Lab Notebooks can be Legal Documents 

* Proof of invention in Patent Cases
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Admissibility in court - must be properly maintained
* Note: Often property of the instituation where the research was conducted (i.e. Property of Regeneron, or Property of Cornell University)

---

# Remember

* Lab notebooks are most importantly scientific documentation
* They represent the scientific process and are record of your **thinking**
    * This means your ideas and conclusions and hypotheses can **change** based on **new data**

---

# Lab Notebook

* Write in **pen**
* All mistakes get a ~~single cross through~~
* Full Date (YYYY/MM/DD) at the beginning of each entry (for multiday labs date start of each day)
* Enter Lab Pages into table of contents 

---

  - Include titles, axis labels with units, and legends where appropriate.

---

# Post Lab

* **Discussion of results**: 
  - Interpret your results in the context of the experiment's objectives.
  - Explain any patterns or trends observed in the data
* **Comparison with hypotheses**: 
  - Explicitly state whether your results support or refute your hypotheses.
  - Discuss possible reasons for any discrepancies.
* **Sources of error and uncertainty**: 
  - Identify potential sources of experimental error.
  - Discuss how these might have affected your results.

# Ball Bounce Lab

#### Question:

Is the coefficient of restitution constant for your ball? Do this by comparing drop height to bounce height for your assigned ball.


#### Background: 

The coefficient of restitution (symbol: $e$) is a dimensionless quantity that describes how much energy is conserved in a collision, specifically how well an object bounces back after impact. It is used to characterize the elasticity of collisions between two bodies.
