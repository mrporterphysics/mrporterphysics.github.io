# What is a Lab Notebook?

* A detailed, chronological record of a scientist's research activities, experiments, and observations. 
* Documentation of the scientific process from intial ideas to final results and conclusions. 

---

# Why keep lab notebooks?

* Document Research
* Develop Ideas
* Organize Data 
* Collaboration Tool
* Publication Support
* Troubleshooting 
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Historical Record

---

# Lab Notebooks can be Legal Documents 

* Proof of invention in Patent Cases
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Admissibility in court - must be properly maintained
* Note: Often property of the instituation where the research was conducted (i.e. Property of Regeneron, or Property of Cornell University)

---

# Remember

* Lab notebooks are most importantly scientific documentation
* They represent the scientific process and are record of your **thinking**
    * This means your ideas and conclusions and hypotheses can **change** based on **new data**

---

# Lab Notebook

* Write in **pen**
* All mistakes get a ~~single cross through~~
* Full Date (YYYY/MM/DD) at the beginning of each entry (for multiday labs date start of each day)
* Enter Lab Pages into table of contents 

---

# Lab Notebook - Pre Lab

* **Title and objective of the experiment**: 
  - Write a clear, concise title for each experiment.
  - State the main objective or purpose of the experiment in 1-2 sentences.
* **Theoretical background**: 
  - Briefly explain the relevant scientific principles.
  - Include key equations or concepts that will be tested or applied.
* **Hypotheses**: 

  - State your predictions about the experiment's outcome.
  - Base these on your understanding of the theory.

---

# Lab Notebook - Pre Lab

* **Materials and equipment list**: 
  - Provide a detailed list of all materials and equipment used.
  - Include model numbers and specifications where relevant.
* **Experimental procedure outline**: 
  - Write a step-by-step outline of the planned procedure.
  - Be specific enough that someone could replicate your experiment.

---

# Post Lab

* **Discussion of results**: 
  - Interpret your results in the context of the experiment's objectives.
  - Explain any patterns or trends observed in the data
* **Comparison with hypotheses**:

# Ball Bounce Lab

#### Question:

Is the coefficient of restitution constant for your ball? Do this by comparing drop height to bounce height for your assigned ball.

# Ball Bounce Lab

#### Question:

Is the coefficient of restitution constant for your ball? Do this by comparing drop height to bounce height for your assigned ball.


#### Background: 

The coefficient of restitution (symbol: $e$) is a dimensionless quantity that describes how much energy is conserved in a collision, specifically how well an object bounces back after impact. It is used to characterize the elasticity of collisions between two bodies.
