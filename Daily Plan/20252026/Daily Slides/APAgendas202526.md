# Ticker Tape Best Practices

- how to set up the spark timer to collect good data:
  - length of tape = length of run, make sure tape is shorter than track so it is pulled all of the way through
  - label tape after collecting data
    - trial #, where zero is
  - need to pull tape through timer **BEFORE** taping to cart
- **Note** You do not need to record _every_ ticker mark...but be sure to follow the 8x10 rule. More data is better here if you have it!

# 📓 Lab Notebooks 📓 <!--fit--->

---

# What is a Lab Notebook?

* A detailed, chronological record of a scientist's research activities, experiments, and observations. 
* Documentation of the scientific process from intial ideas to final results and conclusions. 

---

# Why keep lab notebooks?

* Document Research
* Develop Ideas
* Organize Data 
* Collaboration Tool
* Publication Support
* Troubleshooting 
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Historical Record

---

# Lab Notebooks can be Legal Documents 

* Proof of invention in Patent Cases
* Intellectual Property Protection
* Admissibility in court - must be properly maintained
* Note: Often property of the instituation where the research was conducted (i.e. Property of Regeneron, or Property of Cornell University)

# Remember

* Lab notebooks are most importantly scientific documentation
* They represent the scientific process and are record of your **thinking**
    * This means your ideas and conclusions and hypotheses can **change** based on **new data**

---

# Lab Notebook

# Ball Bounce Lab

#### Question:

Is the coefficient of restitution constant for your ball? Do this by comparing drop height to bounce height for your assigned ball.


#### Background: 

The coefficient of restitution (symbol: $e$) is a dimensionless quantity that describes how much energy is conserved in a collision, specifically how well an object bounces back after impact. It is used to characterize the elasticity of collisions between two bodies.
