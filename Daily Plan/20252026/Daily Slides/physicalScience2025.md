# Survival Island 🏝️

## You and your group are stranded on an deserted island 😮!

### Using *each* of your **unique skill's** develop a plan to escape the island.

1. Whiteboard your response (one person)
2. Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
