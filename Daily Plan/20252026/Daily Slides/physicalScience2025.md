#### 📋 Agenda

1. Review your lab results
2. Ball Bounce Lab - Board Meeting
3. Claim-Evidence-Reasoning
4. Soup-Salad-Sandwich
5. CER Practice

</div>

<div>

# 2026.02.06 **Physical Science**

##### **❓ of the 📅**: Do you lick or bite your ice cream? 

<div class='columns'>
<div>

#### 📋 Agenda

1. Finish graphing ball bounce data
2. Whiteboard Results & Discuss as class
2. Write Ball Bounce Conlusion & Discussion
2. Get Lab Checked by Mr. Porter
4. CER Notes & Practice

</div>
 
<div>


### 🎯 Goals

🥅 _Determine Mathematical Models_


</div>
</div>

# Ball Bounce Lab Whiteboard

- **Sketch** Your Graph
- Write the equation for your best fit
- Think & Discuss with Lab Partners:
    - What does your **slope** represent? 
    - Do you have a vertical intercept? If so what might it represent?

---

# Ball Bounce Lab: **Conclusion** 

1. Identify the type of relationship (_linear, quadratic, inverse, none_) between the bounce height and the release height. Support your answer with evidence and reasoning.

2. Write the equation for your ball. Explain the significance of the slope. (What would it mean for a ball to have a steeper or shallower slope?)

3. Predict the bounce height for a drop height of 250 cm.

# Survival Island 🏝️

## You and your group are stranded on an deserted island 😮!

### Using *each* of your **unique skill's** develop a plan to escape the island.

1. Whiteboard your response (one person)
2. Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
