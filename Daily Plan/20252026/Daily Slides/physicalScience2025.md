# Physical Science

## Mr. Porter

### Maple Hill High School

#### Spring 2025

---

# 2026.02.02 **Physical Science 📏**

##### **❓ of the 📅**: List _two_ pet peeves.

<div class ='columns'>

 <div>

#### 📋 Agenda

1. Lab Notebooks - About
2. [Data Collection Best Practices]() 
2. Ball Bounce Lab
    - Must have data by end of class

</div>

<div>

### 🎯 Goals

🥅 _Design a controlled experiment & collect data._

# Ball Bounce Lab 🏀

### Question:

How is the bounce height of a ball related to the release height of the ball?

### Purpose:

To determine the type of relationship (linear, quadratic, inverse, or constant) that relates the bounce height to the release height.

### In your Notebook

<div class='columns'>
<div>

1. Write question and purpose
2. Write out your **detailed** procedure -> include a sketch

</div>
 
<div>

3. Data Table & Graph
    - Use a ruler and an <mark>**entire**</mark> page for your graph.

# Data Table Example:

| Drop Height (cm) | Bounce Height 1 (cm) | Bounce Height 2 (cm) | Bounce Height 3 (cm) | Average (cm) |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| 20               |                      |                      |                      |              |

# Physical Science Do Now

## If you missed last class please answer the following on an index card:

1. What do you like to be called? What Emoji describes you?	
2. The class is stranded on a deserted island. What special skill(s) can you bring to this dire situation?	
3. What is unique about you that leads to your happiest times and best performances at school?	
4. What is unique about you that allows you to work well in groups for the success of the group as a whole?	
5. What has a teacher done for you in the past which has allowed you to learn?

# Survival Island 🏝️

## You and your group are stranded on an deserted island 😮!

### Using *each* of your **unique skill's** develop a plan to escape the island.

1. Whiteboard your response (one person)
2. Be prepared to share out your plan to escape the island as a group. Each of you should offer a part of the plan to the class.
