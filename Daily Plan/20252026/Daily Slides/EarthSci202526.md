        * Should include details!
        * Refer back to the question, include any data, diagrams, or graphs.

* ### Reasoning:
    * Science principle, such as an equation, law, or definition.
        * This is general, do no include specific details.

# Metric Olympic Presentations

## Claim

What is one thing you can conclude from your graph?

## Evidence

How does you graph support/show what you concluded?

## Reasoning

What is the science or big idea that support your evidence

---

# Claim-Evidence-Reasoning Example

**Claim**: Strong hurricanes start with greatest wind speeds. 

**Evidence**: On the graph the Major Hurricane initial wind speed > Weak hurricane > Tropical storm

**Reasoning**: Hurricanes are in part rated by their windspeed.
