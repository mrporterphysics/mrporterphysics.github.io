# Constructing New York State <!--fit--->

## Complete _Part 1_ with your lab table.

# Domino Discover

## 💡 Ideas

* Volcanic eruptions: quick (1-10 years), can destroy and create land
* Tectonic plate motion: very slow (tens of thousands of years), creates continents, ridges, mountains
* Erosion: long time scale (hundreds to thousands of years), wears away mountains/craters

---

## Mountains and other surface features can form far from plate boundaries. For example, despite New York State’s position in the middle of the North American Plate, it has mountains, rivers, and dramatic cliffs.

# Some Key 🔑 Ideas:

- Earthquakes and volcanic activity happen when plates collide
- In these areas, it appears that one plate goes underneath another one, and earthquakes form there
- On the surface, there are mountains and volcanoes
- Continental crust is the oldest, probably because it is furthest from the midocean ridges but hasn’t collided yet

# Reminder: 

## _We are looking for areas that are most at risk for tectonic activty and its associated natural distasters (i.e. earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis)_

---

# Key Points 🔑

* Earthquakes occur at all types of plate boundaries.  
* Volcanoes form and erupt at oceanic-continental convergent plate boundaries.  
* This further confirms ideas about the earthquake-volcanic eruption phenomenon in Iceland we observed during the Engage phase and volcanic eruptions we have observed during the unit launch, like Krakatoa.  
* Mountains form at convergent plate boundaries.  
* Mid-ocean ridges, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where Iceland is located, form at divergent oceanic-oceanic plate boundaries.  

---

# Key Points 🔑

* Tsunamis are caused by volcano collapses, underwater volcanic eruption, or plates slipping. This helps us explain the occurrence of tsunamis in the unit launch, like the Japan and Krakatoa tsunamis.  
* Mountains form at convergent plate boundaries  
* The amount of time it takes for surface features to form and hazards to occur is directly associated with the time scale of the process that causes them.  
* Some of these phenomena happen very slowly and some happen very suddenly.  

---

# Key Points 🔑

* Surface features can disappear or change form, but natural hazards are not reversible.  
* When an oceanic plate converges with a continental plate the oceanic plate goes underneath because it is more dense.  
* Volcanoes form at divergent plate boundaries because when the plates move apart, the heat from Earth (magma) which has a lot of pressure built up is like a pressure cooker and is able to come up to the surface.

# Discussion & Models <!--fit--->

# Key Points 🔑

* Empirical evidence from radiometric dating tells us that ocean crust is youngest along mid-ocean ridges and gets older as you look further away from those ridges  
* Measuring the rate of change of the sea floor gives us evidence that new crust is being formed very slowly  
* That evidence supports the idea that plates are moving away from each other at these areas, and that new crust is being formed in between, very slowly  
* Empirical evidence shows that earthquakes happen along mid-ocean ridges  

---

# Key Points 🔑 (continued)
* The earthquakes that happen under Iceland, which is on the Atlantic mid-ocean ridge, are shallow and distributed evenly across the ridge.  
* That evidence supports the idea that there is a shallow space between the two sides of the mid-ocean ridge  
* The evidence shows that there is a lot of volcanic activity in Iceland  
* That evidence supports the idea that magma can rise in the space between the two sides of the mid-ocean ridge, which could form the new crust in that area

# Where did Krakatoa’s new islands come from?

- The new islands formed after Krakatoa erupted came from the upper parts of Earth: the crust and the mantle.
- The crust and mantle are made of rock—and rock is usually solid.
- For new islands to appear, some of that rock had to melt into magma, move, and then solidify again near the surface.

_We will be looking at the details of this process today_

<!---
Pause the discussion and ask for clarification, particularly of the following key points:

- There are different parts to the interior of the Earth
- Not all earthquake waves can travel through the different parts of the Earth
- Based on our observations we know that P-waves and S-waves can only travel through certain materials
- Knowing this allows us to determine the state of matter of each of the sections of - Earth’s interior (solid outside layers and a liquid core)
- There are at least 3 layers in Earth

# Explore 1: Composition, Age, and Craters

## Guiding Question
What can the composition and age of rocks from objects in the solar system tell us about its past?

---

## Today’s Goals
- Collect and analyze data on rock ages, composition, and density from Earth, Moon, and other objects.
- Use evidence to explain why craters on other bodies remain stable but craters on Earth change.
- Prepare to model the early solar system.

---

## Materials and Resources
- Handout: Early Solar System Investigation.
- Online simulation: [Radioactive Dating Game (PhET)](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/radioactive-dating-game).
- Class routine: Domino Discover for whole-class synthesis.

---

## Part 1a — Radiometric Decay (Simulation)
Tasks:
- Explore decay of Carbon-14 and Uranium-238.
- Record half-life behavior and decay patterns.

Prompts:
- What patterns do you notice in how fast Carbon-14 changed? Uranium-238?
- How are their rates different, and why does that matter for dating?

---

## Part 1b — Relative Dating (Rock Layers)
Tasks:
- Examine fossil ages within layered rocks.
- Connect layer position to relative age.

Prompts:
- What pattern do you notice within the same layer?
- What pattern occurs as you go to lower layers?
- Which isotope is appropriate for different-aged samples—and why?

---

## Part 2 — Ages Across the Solar System
Tasks:
- Compare ages of minerals from Earth, Moon, Mars, meteorites.
- Note tectonic activity, water, atmosphere presence on different objects.

Prompts:
- What do ages suggest about formation timing of Earth and other objects?
- How might water/atmosphere/tectonics relate to crater counts we observe?

---

## Part 3 — Moon Impact Melt Rocks
Tasks:
- Analyze ages of impact melt rocks (3.75–4.0 billion years).

Prompts:
- What does this suggest about asteroid activity in the early solar system?
- How might similar impacts have affected Mars and Earth?

---

## See–Think–Wonder
- See: What do you notice in the age, composition, and decay data?
- Think: What do these patterns imply about solar system history?
- Wonder: What questions do these data raise about crater stability and change?

Complete your STW on the handout; be ready to share one key idea.

---

## Domino Discover (Whole-Class)
- Share one important idea from your group’s Summary.
- Listen for trends, inferences, and questions.
- Aim: Surface key evidence needed for tomorrow’s explanations.

<!---
Look & Listen For:
- C‑14 half-life ≈ 5,700 years; U‑238 half-life ≈ 4.5 billion years.
- Different isotopes for different age ranges (organic vs. very old rocks).
- Object ages cluster around ~4.40–4.59 BYA → formation window.
- Moon melt rocks 3.75–4.0 BYA → intense bombardment.
- Age alone doesn’t explain crater differences (Moon ≫ Mars ≥ Earth).
--->

---

# Explain 1: Age and the Heavy Bombardment

## Guiding Question
How old are the solar system and the impact craters?

---

## What We’ve Figured Out (Recap)
- Earth, Moon, and Mars formed around the same time (~4.5 BYA).
- Radiometric dating provides consistent ages across multiple bodies.
- Moon’s impact melt rocks date a major bombardment to ~4.0 BYA.
- Crater differences need more than “age” to explain them.

---

## Modeling Task (Triads)
Handout: Explaining the Craters in the Inner Solar System

Steps:
1) Answer the six guiding questions on page 1.
2) Read the short text; use Think–Talk–Open Exchange to compare evidence and claims.
3) Build a brief model of the early inner solar system and its impact history.

Optional context video:
- [The Late Heavy Bombardment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NafhLy22DJQ)

---

## Discussion Prompts
- What evidence supports a Late Heavy Bombardment (~4.0 BYA)?
- If the Moon and Mars show many ancient craters, what should we infer about Earth?
- Where is Earth’s evidence—and why might it be missing from the surface?

---

## Class Consensus Discussion (Structure)
1) Select groups to share; a peer restates each share.
2) Class asks clarifying questions.
3) Confer in table groups; then whole-class consensus.

Focus:
- Link evidence to claims with clear scientific reasoning.
- Make ideas public and visible; elevate accurate explanations.

---

## Key Points to Make Public
- Oldest minerals across Earth/Moon/Mars/other objects ≈ **4.5 BYA** → co-formation from the same dust disk.
- The **Late Heavy Bombardment (~4.0 BYA)** evidenced by dated Moon melt rocks.
- Inner bodies (Mars, Venus) show craters; proximity implies Earth was bombarded too.
- Earth’s surface has changed (hydrologic + geologic processes), which can erase or alter ancient crater evidence.

---

## Summary Task (Individual)
- Write a short explanation: “What was the early solar system like, and what does the evidence suggest about Earth’s impact history?”
- Include:
  - Evidence (ages, isotopes, melt rock dates).
  - Reasoning (why this evidence supports your claim).
  - Clarify where Earth’s surface record may be incomplete and why.

## Engage: Craters and Earth's History

### Essential Questions
- Why do we see so many craters on the Moon and Mars, but not on Earth?
- How often have asteroids struck Earth in the past?

---

## Investigative Phenomenon

- On Earth, about **128** impact craters have been discovered.
- On **Mars**, there are **>300,000**.
- On the **Moon**, there are **>1,000,000**.

What do these differences suggest about stability and change in the solar system?

---

## Today’s Goal

- Examine images of **Mars**, the **Moon**, and **Earth**.
- Identify **patterns** in crater presence and appearance.
- Develop **initial claims** for why Earth shows fewer craters despite similar ages of oldest minerals.

---

## What You’ll Do

1. Individually complete a See–Think–Wonder using the handout:
   - See: What do you observe in the crater images for Mars, Moon, Earth?
   - Think: What patterns or ideas do these observations make you think of?
   - Wonder: What questions do you have about crater differences?

2. In groups, discuss and agree on **one important idea** to share.

3. Use the **Domino Discover** routine to surface class-wide trends.

---


## See–Think–Wonder: Guidance

- See:
  - Count and compare crater density, size, depth, and distribution.
  - Note surface features (erosion, water, atmosphere indicators).

- Think:
  - Consider possible reasons for differences across bodies.
  - Connect to **stability and change** of planetary surfaces.

- Wonder:
  - Ask about formation times, bombardment periods, and surface processes.

---

## Initial Claim (Draft)

- Write a brief **claim** answering:
  - “Why are there so few craters on Earth compared to Mars and the Moon?”

- Support with at least two **observations** from your See–Think–Wonder.

---

## Group Share: Domino Discover

- Each group shares their one key idea.
- Classmates:
  - Repeat/rephrase the idea for clarity.
  - Ask clarifying questions.
  - Note trends across groups.

Goal: Surface **patterns** and **questions** that set up our investigation.

<!---

## Look & Listen For

- “The Moon has almost 10,000× Earth’s craters and >3× Mars.”
- “Crater size/depth seem larger on Moon and Mars.”
- “Age alone may not explain differences—oldest minerals are similar (~4.4–4.6 BYA).”
- “Maybe Earth’s surface changes more over time.”


## Discussion Prompts

- If Mars, Earth, and the Moon formed around the same time,
  why does the Moon have so many more craters?
- If many asteroids hit the Moon ~3.75–4.0 BYA, what likely happened on Earth and Mars?
- What evidence could confirm or refute your claim?

--->



---

## Success Criteria

By the end of Engage, you can:
- Identify key **patterns** in crater data across bodies.
- State a defensible **initial claim** supported by observations.
- Pose **investigable questions** about Earth’s crater record.

---

## Setting Up the Next Step

## Evolution of Life on Earth  

**Directions:**

1. Silently read or watch the “text” provided to you.  
2. Record or annotate three details that are most important to the phenomenon being described for each text.  
3. Share with your group. Each person should identify the details that they circled.  
4. Discuss as a group, and determine the overall story. What is the phenomenon?

---

## **Are We Alone?**

Does life exist somewhere outside of Earth? What about life that has technology and can communicate like humans?



4.5 billion years passed and 5 mass extinctions occurred before humans appeared on Earth. So far we have yet to come in contact with any other beings from another planet or even find evidence that proves any sort of life exists elsewhere.

---

## So are we alone?

Your task in this unit is to work with classmates to investigate some factors that influence the evolution of life on Earth and explain why modern human's emergence on Earth required nearly 4.5 billion years. Then use your findings to make and defend an argument about the probability of  intelligent life existing somewhere outside Earth.

---

## Developing an Initial Explanation 

   
**What set of conditions allowed for the evolution of humans on Earth, and why did it take so long?**

Your first step in this investigation is to consider details from the Tell the Story texts and work with classmates to develop an initial model that illustrates your group's ideas about why it took so long for humans to appear on Earth.

# Kepler’s Third Law: 

### Period–Distance Relationship

_For objects orbiting the same star, the square of the period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) ($T^2 \propto a^3$)._

    - Slowest at **apoapsis** (furthest point).
- Vocabulary:
    - **Periapsis/Apoapsis** (general).
    - Around the Sun: perihelion/aphelion.

# Kepler’s First Law: 

### Orbits are Ellipses

_Planets orbit the Sun in ellipses with the Sun at one focus._

- Key terms:
    - **Semi-major axis (a)**: half of the longest diameter of the ellipse.
    - **Foci**: two special points whose sum of distances to any point on the ellipse is constant.
    - **Eccentricity (e)**: how “stretched” an ellipse is (0: circle; near 1: very elongated).
