# Kepler’s Third Law: 

### Period–Distance Relationship

_For objects orbiting the same star, the square of the period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) ($T^2 \propto a^3$)._

---

# Kepler’s Second Law: 

### Equal Areas in Equal Times

_A planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals._

- Consequences:
    - Fastest at **periapsis** (closest approach).
    - Slowest at **apoapsis** (furthest point).
- Vocabulary:
    - **Periapsis/Apoapsis** (general).
    - Around the Sun: perihelion/aphelion.
    - Around Earth: perigee/apogee.

---

# Kepler’s First Law: 

### Orbits are Ellipses

_Planets orbit the Sun in ellipses with the Sun at one focus._

- Key terms:
    - **Semi-major axis (a)**: half of the longest diameter of the ellipse.
    - **Foci**: two special points whose sum of distances to any point on the ellipse is constant.
    - **Eccentricity (e)**: how “stretched” an ellipse is (0: circle; near 1: very elongated).

$$\boxed{\text{Eccentricity} = \frac{\text{distance between foci}}{\text{length of major axis}}}$$

# Metric Olympic Presentations

## Claim

What is one thing you can conclude from your graph?

## Evidence

How does you graph support/show what you concluded?

## Reasoning

What is the science or big idea that support your evidence

---

# Claim-Evidence-Reasoning Example

**Claim**: Strong hurricanes start with greatest wind speeds. 

**Evidence**: On the graph the Major Hurricane initial wind speed > Weak hurricane > Tropical storm

**Reasoning**: Hurricanes are in part rated by their windspeed.
