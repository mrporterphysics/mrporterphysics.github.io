# AP Physics Dynamics

## Extra Practice 

### DYN. 0 Vector Math
I can add, subtract, and find the components of vectors. 

### DYN 1. Explain, Identify & Diagram Forces 
I can explain contact forces (tension, friction, normal, spring) as arising from interatomic electric forces and that they therefore have certain directions. Additionally, I can identify forces and I can create and use free-body diagrams to analyze physical situations to solve problems with motion qualitatively and quantitatively.

### DYN 2. Mass vs. Weight 
I know the difference between mass and weight and I can apply F = mg to calculate the gravitational force on an object with mass m in a gravitational field of strength g in the context of the effects of a net force on objects and systems.

### DYN 3. N3L 
I can analyze situations involving interactions among several objects by using free-body diagrams that include the application of Newton's third law.

### DYN 4. N2L 
I can predict the motion of an object subject to forces exerted by several objects using an application of Newton's second law in a variety of physical situations with acceleration in one dimension. I can also reexpress a free-body diagram representation into a mathematical representation and solve the mathematical representation for the acceleration of the object.

### DYN 5. Inclined Planes 
I can predict the motion of an object subjected to forces on an inclined plane through the use of Free Body Diagrams and Newton's Second Law. 

### DYN 6. N2L Systems 
I can apply Newton's second law to systems to calculate the change in the center-of-mass velocity when an external force is exerted on the system.
