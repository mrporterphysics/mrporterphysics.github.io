# AP Physics Kinematics

## Extra Practice 

### KIN 0. Vector vs. Scalar 
I can differentiate between vector and scalar quantity pairs such as distance & displacement and speed & velocity. I can represent vectors in diagrams or mathematically by appropriately labeled the vectors with magnitude, direction, and units during the analysis of a situation.

### KIN 1. Express Motion 
I can express the motion of an object or system using narrative, mathematical, and graphical representations.
#### Physics Classroom Practice:

### KIN 2. Predict Motion 
I can make predictions about the of a system based on the fact that acceleration is equal to the change in velocity per unit time, and velocity is equal to the change in position per unit time. I can use the kinematic equations.

### KIN 3. Motion Graphical Analysis
I can create mathematical models and analyze graphical relationships for acceleration, velocity, and position of the center of mass of a system and use them to calculate properties of motion of the center of mass of a system.

### KIN 4. Average vs. Instantaneous 
I can differentiate between average and instantaneous speed, velocity, acceleration and solve problems relating to those physical quantities.

### KIN 5. Projectile Motion 
I can solve problems involving objects experiencing projectile motion.
