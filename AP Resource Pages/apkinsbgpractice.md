# AP Physics Kinematics

## Extra Practice 

### KIN 0. Vector vs. Scalar 
I can differentiate between vector and scalar quantity pairs such as distance & displacement and speed & velocity. I can represent vectors in diagrams or mathematically by appropriately labeled the vectors with magnitude, direction, and units during the analysis of a situation.

_This standard is built into questions with the other standards. It checks that you are treated vector quantities as vectors (including + and signs correctly) and scalar quantities as scalars._

### KIN 1. Express Motion 
I can express the motion of an object or system using narrative, mathematical, and graphical representations.

### KIN 2. Predict Motion 
I can make predictions about the of a system based on the fact that acceleration is equal to the change in velocity per unit time, and velocity is equal to the change in position per unit time. I can use the kinematic equations.
